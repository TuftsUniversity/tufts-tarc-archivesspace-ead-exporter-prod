    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>William Northrop Morse (1882-1977) was a professor of dramatic literature at Tufts College from 1928 to 1935. At Tufts, he wrote, directed, and assisted in student theater productions, including those produced by the Pen, Paint, and Pretzels (3Ps), The Masque Society (Jackson College's dramatic society), and course-related productions.</p><p>William Northrop Morse was born in Amherst, Massachusetts on May 22, 1882 to Anson D. Morse, a history professor at Amherst College, and Margaret D. Morse. After graduating from Phillips Academy in 1900, he received his B.A. from Amherst in 1904. He received his A.M. from Harvard in 1905 and spent time at Harvard Graduate School from 1921-1923 and 1924-1926.</p><p>He served as an instructor and director of dramatics at Washington University from 1923 to 1924 before becoming an associate professor at Middlebury in 1926 and professor in 1927. While at Middlebury, he supervised and directed student productions from the college's student dramatic club. </p><p>In 1928, Morse became a Professor of Dramatic Literature at Tufts. While at Tufts, he taught play production and continued his support of student theater through his involvement in Tufts College's dramatic society, Pen, Paint, and Pretzels (3Ps), and Jackson College's dramatic society, the Masque Society, before its merge with the 3Ps in 1930. During this time, he directed and assisted in student productions from the 3Ps, the Masque Society, and other Tufts affiliated groups and departments, including the Tufts Graduate Dramatic Society and the English Department's playwriting course. Student productions included Morse's own original works. He taught at Tufts until 1935. </p><p>After his time at Tufts, Morse taught at Middlesex University in Waltham, Massachusetts and Mount Ida Junior College in Newton, Massachusetts before retiring to become a freelance writer, residing in Newton Highlands, Massachusetts. He died in 1977 at the age of 95. </p>  </bioghist>
