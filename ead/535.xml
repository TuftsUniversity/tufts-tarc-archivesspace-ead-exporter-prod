    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Frederick Crosby Hodgdon was born February 8, 1873 in Waltham, Massachusetts. Mr. Hodgdon entered Tufts College in 1890 and graduated in 1894.  He was a member of the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity and Phi Beta Kappa. He was elected an alumni trustee in 1923 and a life trustee in 1935. He was also a member of the Board of Visitors. He and his wife Jeannette made a substantial bequest to the College in 1952.</p>  

<p>Hodgdon was hired by Edwin Ginn and Company, the publishing house, when he graduated from Tufts. Edwin Ginn was an alumnus of Tufts graduating in 1862.  Hodgdon became a partner at the company in 1912 and retired in 1931. He and his wife collected antique furniture, lustre ware, ruby flash glass, and 18th century silver. Many of these items were donated to Tufts in their bequest. They also owned a townhouse at 4 Gramercy Park in New York City. Frederick C. Hodgdon died in 1946.</p>  </bioghist>

Mr. Hodgdon was a student and later trustee of Tufts University.  Most of the material dates from the 1920s to 1952, when Jeannette Hodgdon died and a significant donation was made to Tufts University from the estate. The items are cataloged at the folder level. The letters mostly fall into two categories: those between Tufts University president John A. Cousens from Mr. Hodgdon and, secondly, letters between Leonard Carmichael (president 1938-1953), both Hodgdons, their lawyers and other associates.  Included in the papers are original receipts and letters regarding objects that later were donated to Tufts. In addition, there are greeting cards and photographs, negatives, and drawings of the Hodgdon house in Gramercy Park. There is also a copy of a book published by Mrs. Hodgdon.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_09f0f1955dc1e241ae517cec774a7394"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged into folders organized according to date and correspondent, as well as a separate folder for Mrs. Hodgdon's book, copies of receipts, and one for the photographs and images.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_384c20a6cc6bf9524d7385baab642130"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_d5864bce9a7f14d7e929efb9df3c924e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence of F.C.
