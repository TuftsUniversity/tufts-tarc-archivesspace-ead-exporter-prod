    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Founded in 1969, the Africana Center was developed in recognition of the realities of the needs and concerns of the students of African descent on a predominately white campus. The Center works to enhance the academic mission of the university by ensuring that students of African descent have access to a variety of academic, cultural and student resources that encourages them to have a successful Tufts experience and prepares them to be leaders for a wide range of professional experiences. In addition, the Center works to ensure that students have access to all necessary resources, advises the administrative and academic offices of the university on such issues and advocates proactively for students. The Africana Center is Located at 8 Professors Row on the 1st Floor. The second and third floors of the building serve as a living and learning space (Capen House) for fifteen undergraduates who reside in the house during the academic year. These students are selected each year to live in the dorm and work as a community to complete individual and group projects which celebrate the rich cultural heritage of people of African descent.</p>  </bioghist>
