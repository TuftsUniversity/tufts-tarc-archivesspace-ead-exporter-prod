<p>Beginning in 2014, Tisch Library staff provided subject headings for all theses deposited through the Samvera administrative interface, MIRA.</p><p>As of February 2016, theses and qualifying papers are collected and managed by Tisch Library and are searchable in the Tufts University Library Catalog. DCA remains the permanent steward, but this finding aid is no longer updated with new accessions.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The distinction of honors in the undergraduate curriculum existed as early at 1877, both for "in course" achievement and "Special Honors" work. Departments had varying requirements and criteria for awarding honors.  In 1957 a Committee on Honors was established to systematize rules for awarding Honors in both in course and Special Honors programs. By the 1960s it was common for many departments, at least in the humanities, to require a thesis for honors consideration, and the undergraduate honors thesis program was administered by the office of the Dean of the College.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Digital Collections and Archives started transitioning to collecting honors theses in digital form. In 2014, the Digital Collections and Archives started accepting honors theses by deposit through the Samvera administrative interface, MIRA. For Arts, Sciences, and Engineering students, supervising advisers are asked to confirm that thesis submissions were awarded honors.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The collection is made up of theses written by undergraduate students from various departments as part of the requirements for honors in their department.  All students are asked to deposit copies of their theses in the archives, but not all do so, therefore the collection is incomplete.  The earliest thesis dates from 1929, but most date from the 1960s onward.</p><p>Some theses may be under an embargo and not available online until the end of the embargo period.</p>  </scopecontent>

The Pakistanis and Irish have been chosen for the way race, religion, and class were used within their immigrant communities and among the white public to create social and cultural barriers in northern industrial cities, and how Empire-based British views towards these subjects carried over to interactions in the mother country. West Yorkshire has been chosen not only for its history of immigration, but also for the notable conflicts that it witnessed from the arrival of the Famine Irish in the 1840s to the radicalization of British Muslims in the 1980s. Are parallels between the Pakistanis and Irish usefully only in instructing our perceptions of British attitudes towards black immigrants, or do the two groups' shared experiences and moments of cultural contact say something more profound about immigrant lives in Great Britain?</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2bf2c8b3122b3442e822ffc40fb244be"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5fae9cb96c5a7c397566259a46296b0b" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Littoral Difference: Examining the Swahili and Malabar Coasts during the Islamic Golden Age</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.063.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Glassman, Daniel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d156be27456adb95fe75a53117e297cd">The Islamic Golden Age roughly spans the period from the 8th to the 16th century. Often seen as fringe territories in relation to the locus of Muslim power, the Malabar and Swahili coasts were major beneficiaries of this Pax Islamica. This thesis compares these regions in order to test a common generalization about coastal civilization: that it is inclusive, tolerant, heterogeneous, and above all, cosmopolitan. Through a closer look at Islam's reception on the coasts, we find that cultural exchange was nuanced through the means of trade and commerce. The evidence indicates that geographical position defines the nature of contact and communication, rather than universally shaping the attitudes of coastal society.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bf3c0643fc5ec3cfca0fa06373238325"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_67b6e054ed40529d4d9172ff5cd3fab5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Doomed from the Start: a New Perspective on the Malayan Insurgency</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.064.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stahl, Eric</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a74d295468b8b380945d2ec0144c0196">A few years after the end of World War II, the British fought a successful, twelve-year jungle counterinsurgency against communist guerrillas.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_836e7d730db2340c36a4a78cb7bea4d6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e88b871760033b1d135fe44c63832117" level="item"><did><unittitle>Mourning in America: The Assassination of Ambassador Adolph Dubs and the Deterioration of U.S.-Soviet-Afghan Relations</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.065.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dolin, Rachel B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5d6154fbab8e8b8a6ffb52a25f8d8899">On February 14, 1979, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Adolph Spike Dubs, was kidnapped and murdered by an anti-government organization in Kabul, Afghanistan, touching off a series of events that not only altered the nature of U.S.-Soviet-Afghan relations but also changed President Jimmy Carter's foreign-policy agenda for the rest of his term. In chronicling the events leading up to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, historians have largely focused on the Saur Revolution in April 1978 -- a communist coup led by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan -- as a turning point in U.S.-Soviet-Afghan relations, ignoring the impact of the Dubs affair or, at most, mentioning it in passing. Dubs' murder has been taken at face value as merely a tragic event in the history of a diplomatic relationship marred by similar incidents. Its impact deserves further scrutiny, as a close investigation of the events of Feb. 14, the days that immediately followed
                and the shift in the policies of all three countries in the months leading up to December reveals that the assassination of Dubs irrevocably altered the nature of the triangle that was U.S.-Afghan-Soviet relations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_191ac118b7fd3e49e34f94a007dab99f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ec63ed780f9298fc95a1fe90236e47ca" level="item"><did><unittitle>Primitivist Power Plays: The Role of Robert Estienne's Temple Illustrations in the Creation of English Worship Space, 1560-1711</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.066.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chiang, Olivia Mae Lan</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_7646e1c16338f3467da89621179d2900" label="Books [39090015513597b]" type="box">Volume 66</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5c704e870b6ef941890a9067b886451f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0ebfb0e6efaeb37ec94d522b013c4172" level="item"><did><unittitle>Igniting Independence: Pyrophobia and Crowd Action in Eighteenth Century Boston</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.067.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sokol, Rebekah Bari</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_000eda8a5d3389de478e13e62fa66474">One of the most predominant fears in America in the eighteenth century was of fire. An equalizer of all social classes and economic strata in its wake, fires surged through Boston on numerous occasions. Fire was terrifying unto itself, but colonists also feared the use of fire as a weapon, especially if they thought those setting fires did so on behalf of a vast conspiracy. Americans over time developed the danger of fire into a symbol for the Revolution, and even government supporters used the symbol to describe the colonists' behavior. Everyone in Britain and in Boston had a working definition of fire, but when that fire became a weapon or a signal for crowd actions in the 1760s, bonfires and gatherings under the pretense of extinguishing a blaze gained added significance. Crowds used fire as a way to assemble groups, terrify their opponents, and demonstrate their mounting frustrations with British rule. Further, British crowd action in 1780 demonstrated a flow
                of information stemming from America; Britons noticed American fire usage and adopted the symbol for their own causes. The revolutionary spirit of crowds continued to influence civilian and government interactions even following the War, and the crowd's use of fire survives as a symbol of American ingenuity and the power of the common people</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b4b94c272a8752914cb6776e370dabb6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_813b94a97d31ec9629c4e16281678cef" level="item"><did><unittitle>'For Arts &amp; Commerce Promoted:' The West Indian Influence in the Development of British Cartography 1750-1800</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.068.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sacks, Benjamin James</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e2e4340d31bf4729fa3adc3bf18b7853">At the beginning of the eighteenth-century British navigators, surveyors, and officials were largely forced to rely on French and Dutch maps or inferior English charts. The lack of a cohesive and professional domestic cartography industry was problematic, in particular, for British shipping. Mapping errors resulted in the incalculable loss of ships, men, and cargo. After circa 1759, however, mapmaking in Britain was prioritized; by the beginning of the nineteenth-century London was the world's leading map production center. Although the role of the East India Company and the British Isles in this 'renaissance' have been extensively explored, little historiography exists concerning the influence of the West Indies in the development of British cartography. The West Indies were extremely important to British commerce, and West Indies commerce helped propel British mapmaking.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d10644552496fd1b0b07a98b534365c1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_891ffaf70f522123f972531ede9823af" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Power of the Council: The Canons of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, New Models for Spirituality</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.069.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, Benjamin J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6d7eefc1c6e2e2a67863b057adefa078">This thesis examines the actual text, in English translation, of the canons of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 in their historical context.

It is therefore an attempt at an analysis of the Fourth Lateran Council itself: its purposes, its goals, and its achievements. In showing the significance all of these canons played in the history of the Latin Christian tradition, this thesis hopes to place the council rightfully as a pivotal moment in western Christianity and a source of much of medieval, Renaissance and modern Christian practice.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_66059011e59e08d6ecb76aaf30a7dfac"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7d5417377600a31fcb163e6392862a58" level="item"><did><unittitle>Saving Souls, Enslaving Bodies: The Jesuits &amp; African Slavery in Colonial Peru, 1580-1650</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.070.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pickard, Duncan Mayher</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d5a49511f8b8002bf3dfe63dd5d4705f">This paper explores the Jesuits' African slave trade network between the port at Cartagena, Colombia, and the dozen sugar and wine plantations in coastal Peru, and the Jesuits' system of control over the African slaves on their plantations.

Cosplay, short for "costume play," is a subculture of Japanese anime (animation) and manga (comics) fandom in which fans dress up as their favorite characters. In an era of increasingly globalized media, cosplay is a uniquely Japanese form of soft power which, playing upon the "identificatory fantasy," enables Western participants to assume identities and achieve levels of Otherness in ways which Western cultural products cannot equal. The average cosplayer is not merely putting on a costume; the experience is one of metamorphosis, a transformation of identity, a phenomenon which I explore on both an individual and societal level. Yet, all of this begs the question of intent: why do people do it? Is this simply a form of subcultural escapism or is it yet another Orientalist mode, a
                vehicle for Western fetishization and domination of Eastern identities? There is a rich historical tradition of Western cultural imperialism in regards to Japanese culture, beginning with popularization of Japanese ukiyo-e prints in Paris in the seventeenth century, expanding from there. This is by no means a new behavior, but it is a relatively unexamined one and through the paper, I examine the the role of fandom in the formation of modern identity, trace the historical roots of cosplay, and finally I seek to synthesize scholarship with fieldwork in order to determine whether cosplay is a manifestation of cultural imperialism of cultural hybridity.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2225427d59f2ccf4802fff0d301a4886"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fe0785b16b81a68a996dbaa7a67b8120" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Rhetoric of Revolution and Reality: Boulangism and Mass Politics in France</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.072.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lerer, David S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c77d2ae19d92d0601eb539adb92ec33d">The political history of the first century of modern France reads as a continuous succession of revolutions and upheavals, occurring at fairly regular intervals of about twenty years, each deposing the existing government and substituting an often radically different one in its place. This paradoxical "revolutionary tradition," cultivated in a country in which the only constant was change, became an undeniable fixture of the political landscape. The revolutionary challenge of Boulangism threatened the Third Republic with a fate similar to the regimes that had preceded it. Boulangism was a popular movement rooted primarily in the immense popularity of the notorious General Boulanger, behind whom rallied all the enemies of the Republic: monarchists seeking a royal restoration, Bonapartists hoping for a new empire, nationalists yearning for revenge on Germany, socialists envisaging a proletarian uprising. At its height in 1889, the movement was expected to topple the government, but it faltered and fell apart, eventually compelling Boulanger to kill himself on the grave of his mistress. Boulangism was more, however, than a tragicomedy of failed political aspirations. Through an experimental and unprecedented campaign of propaganda and party organization that spanned the whole of France, it revealed the possibilities of electoral competition in an incipient mass political landscape at the same time that it showed the bankruptcy of the revolutionary tradition it purported to revitalize. This thesis examines the electoral innovations of Boulangism and traces the rhetoric of the affair as it evolved from revolutionary invocation against the government to appeals to legal, electoral participation within it. It also investigates the coincidence of Boulangism with the centenary of the French Revolution and the famous Universal Exposition, which forced political actors, including the government itself, to critically re-examine the French revolutionary legacy and the continued relevance of revolution in a participatory democracy. From this perspective of the transition from revolutionary to mass politics, the Boulanger Affair can help contextualize the origins of twentieth-century political groupings, from the social democratic left to the proto-fascist right.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8fe76aa65cd3d4d60c0efc417c080d6c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Fascism</subject><subject source="local">Politics and government</subject><persname source="local">Boulanger, George-Ernest-Jean-Marie</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_711374c02cf0cf3ce3bdbaec90860a1d" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Bread and Butter of Transition: Agriculture in Bulgaria, 1989-1997</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.073.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kolev, George I.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_203ec9c493ba65856b2136e8aa8f2853">When the wall fell in 1989, many in Eastern Europe elatedly expected that prosperity – compared with the misery of the preceding years – lay ahead. As the unraveling of decades' worth of centralization began, however, it became clear that the collapse of planned economies would, indeed, be a collapse, unless prompt, painful and multilateral reforms were initiated. In no other country was this more evident than in Bulgaria, where the communist party won the first free elections, and shock therapy measures were thus ruled out from the onset. Bulgaria's agriculture, which had accounted for a big chunk of the country's exports and almost a quarter of its workforce, saw a dramatic decline, which was accompanied by inflation, a staggering foreign debt, and civil unrest and lasted until sustained and consistent reform began in 1997. This paper analyzes the longevity and scope of this decline and attributes it to the simultaneous impacts of political instability, an unclear and inequitable process of privatization, and reforms insensitive to the farmers' vote.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_294bda0a64af05fe451381ab4faf63f9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Agriculture--Economic aspects</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1ce14aaff0c403208826ddf72b396c34" level="item"><did><unittitle>Alexander's Final Army</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.074.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Miller, Jonathan A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_aab3091f56088ac15598f6a617eb7f3a">During the reigns of Philip II and his son Alexander III (the Great), the kingdom of Macedonia grew to encompass an area stretching from the Danube to the Indus, and from Egypt to Uzbekistan. This period of expansion was the product of a newly reformed Macedonian army. However, at the time of Alexander's death in 323 the army was undergoing significant changes, not only in structure but also in composition. Iranians were extensively being pulled into its ranks, despite the outcry from the Macedonian rank and file. What was it that Alexander hoped to accomplish by reforming the most powerful military of the age? To answer this question, I cross-referenced the surviving ancient histories of Alexander's campaigns with what is known about Macedonia before and during Philip's reign. As it turns out, no one paradigm defined the relationships between myriad subject peoples and the Macedonian king. Rather, numerous political structures developed, all of which linked the inhabitants of Macedonian-dominated regions to the Macedonian military, over which the Macedonian kings exercised direct control. Philip cemented these relationships into constitutionally bounded and legitimatized structures, which would form the basis upon which Alexander began building his empire in Asia. This process was far from complete when he dies in 323 BC at the age of 32. Alexander's true plans for his empire, therefore, can best be viewed from an analysis of the military changes he initiated, and where the integration of the Iranians fit within that paradigm.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b8a85c567c363dfa866ac86e3e18c070"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Ancient Macedonia</subject><corpname source="local">Alexander, the Great, 356-323 B.C.</corpname><corpname source="local">Philip II, King of Macedonia, 382-336 B.C.</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_282cbecd8a3ed4a090bb4a21b21f730e" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Absolute Destruction of their Interest: New England and Jefferson's Embargo</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.075.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Knecht, Rachel Eve</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9b8198c85d385905f45805457e925587">In December 1807, in response to the wars in Europe, President Thomas Jefferson laid a total embargo on American shipping. Within a year, the policy had pushed the United States to the brink of civil war. The embargo inflamed sectional distrust and animosity toward the south in New England; its citizens perceived the embargo to be a southern attack on their regional interests, an effort to subjugate the "commercial states" to Virginian tyranny. In order to win votes, New England's Federalists, whose party had steadily declined in influence since 1800, portrayed themselves as the region's defenders, to popular and electoral success. In using strident sectional rhetoric, however, they threatened to create a partisan-sectional division between the Jeffersonian Republican south and the Federalist northeast. As a result, the New England members of Jefferson's party broke with the president, in order to preserve both the Republican sectional coalition and the American union. By securing the embargo's repeal, they reassured New Englanders of their ability to affect national policy, and staved off the solidification of a regional divide in partisan politics. But they also split their party between north and south. While keeping the embargo crisis from becoming a civil war, the New England Republicans failed to resolve the deep-seated regional division in the United States, ultimately acquiescing to popular sectionalism.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c4ab4e795fe1d1344fddb469e46d7151"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Federal Party (U.S.)</subject><subject source="local">Politics and government</subject><persname source="local">Jefferson, Thomas, 1743-1826</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_60eb8c1dcc8ed2f1ad8ad7bb067758ae" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Lot of Little Things Are Wrong: The Tenacity of Gender Roles in Drug Advertisements in an Era of Change</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.076.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mauksch, Claire S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fb9b73aeaf322deebe788726c159e38f">This thesis is an examination of the gendering of drug advertisements from 1955-1972.

Specifically it looks at how political actors and the public reacted to this change in American political culture. The work then examines the post-Watergate political reforms, the rise of citizen-lobbies, and how Watergate contributed to the rise of Ronald Reagan and conservative shift in American politics in the 1980's and 1990's.

It argues that sowing the ground and working with the soil was considered good for the soul, according to these institutions and communities. With a number of most Transcendentalist communities, mental hospitals, and almshouses rejecting the sole use of farming by the mid- to late 1800s, agriculture faded from popularity and other practices were utilized. However, the presence of farming in the nineteenth century was just one part of a recurring cycle of the popularity of agriculture, as can be seen by the number of agrarian revivals in the early twentieth century, 1960s, and today. By analyzing these three movements in the context of industrialization and religious revivalism, particularly in New England, this thesis examines
                why farming became the predominant activity utilized by a number of nineteenth-century institutions, and why the ideal faded and transformed in the later decades of the 1800s.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b751c97101a052306290feff5f3bb293"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of History</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_34a5fc693a79d28f426bbfa85b053183" level="item"><did><unittitle>Political Power in Medieval Borderlands</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.083.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Luz-Alterman, Jeffrey N.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_23ed9830573b184fc64b3b4355d0d36a">Political Power in Medieval Borderlands</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f805307aedf39e1692d23c23a296c68c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of History</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b5c486d4d240a98b21a83f3fec6d0b9f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Westward unto Eden: Thoreau, Emerson, and America's National Epic</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.084.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Whelan, John I.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_daf137b019abe7445fe83c9346adf32c">This thesis explores the Transcendentalists' involvement in debates regarding slavery and American expansionism in the mid-nineteenth century.

Between 1968 and 1972 the Boston chapter of the Black Panther Party was active in the city, centered in the African American community primarily in Roxbury. This work is twofold. First, it is a study of a non-studied branch of the Party, bringing to light much of the character of the Boston Panthers. It also provides a stepping stone for those scholars wishing to pursue further research on the Black Panther Party of Boston. The second main objective of this work is the redefining of Panther historiography through a lens of social programs rather than violence. The Black Panther Party, in both common conception and scholarship, has been too focused on the violent aspects of the Party. This work serves as a new model of Panther historiography, one focused on those aspectsand branchesof the Party least discussed. The Boston Panthers are little remembered because they
                engaged in no shoot outs with police, and kept safe from the assassin's bullets of FBI-planned raids. But, these qualities are a positive to the branch, not a negative. The situation of the Boston branch, in addition, helps Panther historiography by providing this new framework for an understudied, but incredibly important, Black Panther Party chapter.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_690107dd4ed4f473ab745ade4bc0caf7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of History</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_86ddd712d484556bda83839fcc40edc0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Brother Warriors: American Indian Soldiers in the Continental Army</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.087.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Denney, Jacob Thomas</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_86a21659571b4c77763a4f904763f022">Collective memory tends to overlook Native American involvement in the Revolutionary War. Many Native Americans became active participants, serving as emissaries, spies, rangers, and as enlisted and commissioned regular soldiers and officers. These men made the decision to fight, and for whom, on both an individual and a tribal level. American Indian soldiers were motivated by a variety of factors ranging from kin ties to economics and a belief in the patriot's cause. Focusing on the northeastern American colonies, this study makes extensive use of anecdotal as well as statistical evidence inlaying a framework for understanding American Indian involvement in the Continental Army.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_90bf7b702fce1e82f3c6b2ba63a4bcc9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of History</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c9abb5fc102713fe91bd1ae3ef4a22e1" level="item"><did><unittitle>The "Unraveling": Resistance to Desegregation in the Pittsburgh Public Schools, 1971-1998</unittitle><unitid>UA005.001.088.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">William Dodge Rutherford</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2a47839f27356bc8b46df0d8ed5a8934">Decades of work by Black parents and activists in Pittsburgh preceded the process of desegregation, which was an attempt to break down a racist system that maintained separate and unequal schools. There was never full desegregation in Pittsburgh, and in the 1990s a period of resegregation undid some of the changes made under the 1980 desegregation plan. Three phases of resistance to desegregation explain why there was partial desegregation followed by a period
                                of resegregation. The first phase took place at the grassroots level after the Board of Public Education passed a mild desegregation plan in 1971. The main opposition to this plan was a boycott of a predominantly Black school by parents of 47 students from Carrick, a White, working- and middle-class neighborhood. Underlying causes of this boycott included a desire for "neighborhood schools," racism, and a lack of representation on the Board of Education. No one
                                from Carrick served on the Board, which at the time was appointed by a group of judges. The second phase of resistance to desegregation began with the transition from an appointed Board to an elected Board in 1976. In the new, nine-member elected Board, five White members formed a "conservative faction" that opposed adopting citywide desegregation plan. A more moderate faction of Board members passed a partial desegregation plan in 1980 that focused on magnet
                                schools to create "voluntary" desegregation instead of requiring all students to attend desegregated schools. Part of this plan included "busing" students to schools outside their neighborhoods, which was the target of the third phase of resistance in the mid-1990s. From 1995 to 1998, the Board of Education and state legislature overturned parts of the 1980 desegregation plan. From the early 1970s to the late 1990s, resistance to desegregation mounted what was, in
                                the words of one former superintendent, the "unraveling" of desegregation in the Pittsburgh Public Schools.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3b4e0d65c4d42a84d833b03a393ba9da"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In 1965, President Johnson's progressive social reforms set a tone for developing bilingual education policy. Given the newly increased immigrant population and federal funding to schools, the era initiated political sympathy to students of Limited English Proficiency (LEP). For a quarter
                                century, federal and state legislation facilitated programs that would support those students by developing their native languages alongside English. By the 1990s, opinions about how to teach LEP students had changed, matching a conservative turn in American social policy. New legislation banned native languages from schools in several states, including Massachusetts, thereby drastically shifting the way students learned. This thesis draws correlations between
                                those pieces of legislation and broader American life. Changing socio-economic and socio-political climates in the United States shape the trajectory of bilingual education policy through its undulations since 1965. Overall, this thesis examines issues of immigration and national identity through a lens of bilingual education.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a048967e821800c89a6fb57bec630679"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's theory of the production of space, I trace the production of colonial capitalist space in the two countries, emphasizing the impact of sugar production in Cuba and urban development in Uruguay. I then analyze the guerrilla interventions into Cuban and Uruguayan space, engaging with the theory and practice of rural and urban guerrilla warfare (with an emphasis on the writing of Che Guevara, Regis Debray, and leading Tupamaros). Special attention is given to the possibility of producing a new kind of transformative, revolutionary 'guerrilla space' that attempts to prefigure socialist space. I argue that liberated territory is key to the revolutionary process, and that spatial analysis helps us understand its importance.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The ethical tenet of moral equality is powerful since it identifies wrongs that are often difficult to name and supports other core human rights. Although there are serious concerns over how equal moral treatment plays into an international system of human rights, I believe moral equality is important enough (at least by virtue of its effects) to garner widespread support among nations and serve as a useful lens for human rights practitioners.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3739b6a6902f083ade118191834e6972"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Philosophy</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f7067455d11011f89a1f99d0def681e6" level="item"><did><unittitle>Parts, Differences, and Statues</unittitle><unitid>UA005.002.023.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mercogliano,John Alfred</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4c61761923e8d3a39eaea7d33f17b6da">The goal of this paper is to defend the principle of the uniqueness of composition against a potential counter-example. Common sense says that sometimes objects compose another object. For example, molecules of clay, when properly arranged, might compose a statue. Some have claimed further that these molecules of clay can simultaneously compose a statue-shaped lump of clay that occupies the same region of space that the statue occupies but is distinct from it. The lump and the statue are distinct, it is claimed, because they differ in their modal properties. The former could survive radical deformation, but the latter couldn't. I reject this as it implies that these modal properties are emergent. In this paper I propose a novel argument against emergent properties, based on the notion of 'levels of decomposition' and on vagueness and I attempt to explain away the intuition that the lump and the statue differ in their modal properties. This involves building up a general account of de re modal predication according to which objects have their modal properties relative to a sortal, a result of which is that a single object can appear to have different modal properties under different descriptions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1e77531c2698509860c217c2669d4e81"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Philosophy</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3e2a0923b3c6f86fff676d528fdd6f0c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Joint Action and Hominin Cognitive Evolution</unittitle><unitid>UA005.002.024.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">McLoone, Brian</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0bbc10f0d8c25eaeb7432cf8b75fa523">Humans have the rare ability to team up with others to accomplish shared tasks.

The measurement of Avogadro's number is considered the central feature in this accomplishment. In 1908, Perrin measured Avogadro's number from experimental work on the Brownian movement. By 1913, he published 'Les Atomes' where he brought together 13 different equations to measure this constant based on work by him and his contemporaries. The convergence of Avogadro's number across these equations has long been considered the crux of the argument for molecular reality. In this paper, I have pointed out that numerical convergence by itself only construes Avogadro_�_s number as a constant of proportionality. The evidence that Avogadro's number is an integer and that matter is discrete is found in the details of the experiments. I look at indirect verifications of discreteness in measurements of the elementary charge and the number of alpha particles emitted from radioactive substances. I then look at the direct verification of discreteness in the Brownian movement of granules.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7e4ca96f477208eb0e99c38fe0ee7a51"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_d1f34fdaba6f88265e1e02dad5b583b1" level="item"><did><unittitle>In Defense of John Rawls's Solution to the Problem of Incompatible Pluralism in Democratic Society and an Application of Political Liberalism in Our Own</unittitle><unitid>UA005.002.027.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lapin, John Jacob</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_561c9a8e530877372776fd3237e5cb7e">Most political philosophies have tried to argue in favor of a particular idea of the good and have tried to convince others to endorse that idea. But can we really hope to enact public policy based on a single idea of the good in a democracy, where there is a pluralism of reasonable views? In this thesis, I argue that the only way we can hope to create legitimate and stable public policy is by setting aside the points of contention, since we will never agree on those anyway, and since enacting policy for everyone based exclusively on a particular view would be unduly coercive to those who do not hold that view. I will argue that we have a duty to our fellow citizens to deliberate publicly by presenting each other justifications for views that we reasonably think other citizens like us would accept. In the first half of my thesis, I will explore and defend John Rawls's expression of this view. Though I will use the contemporary abortion debate as an example of a contentious culture war issue that could be resolved through a Rawlsian framework, the solution could be used for other issues, too. In the second half of my thesis, I will broaden his view to apply it to our actual polity to show how we can make 21st century American democracy more legitimate, stable, and transparent.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_44ff4149a654f23439cc2c751a7bc83b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Philosophy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_99531ffcc79fe25f979a0c83538467cf" level="item"><did><unittitle>Spinoza and Leibniz on Faith and Reason</unittitle><unitid>UA005.002.028.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Adelson, Madeleine C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a8735e41ce3250d6dfebdc54d5575203">The relationship between faith and reason raises many questions. Does faith imply a belief that is contrary to reason, or outside of reason? Do our beliefs based on faith bring us closer to truth, as reason does? Are truths about the divine accessible through reason, and if not, does it do us any good to try to comprehend them?Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz were concerned with the relationship between faith and reason, and come up with very different answers to these questions. While Spinoza argues in his Theological-Political Treatise that the common man's faith is absolutely divorced from reason, as only reason leads us to truth, Leibniz argues in his Theodicy that faith and reason go hand in hand, as both are paths toward truth. Both philosophers acknowledge the existence of truths (such as truths about the divine) beyond the average person's level of comprehension; however, Spinoza thinks the philosopher can reach these truths through extensive study, while Leibniz thinks no human is capable of understanding them. For Spinoza, then, faith becomes nothing more than the consideration of incomplete ideas in lieu of better understanding, a sort of lack or error in reasoning. For Leibniz, faith is a necessary step towards explaining the divine and involves more understanding rather than less. In my thesis, I intend to show that Leibniz's account proves more useful and charitable in describing faith. While Spinoza's complete separation of faith and reason is initially tempting, his views as expressed in his Ethics ultimately lead to the conclusion that the average person's ideas regarding the divine are not just incomplete, but false  despite numerous attempts to avoid this conclusion. Leibniz, on the other hand, allows for varying degrees of depth in understanding, giving us a more charitable picture of what faith is to the faithful. By comparing each philosopher's treatment of the relationship between faith and reason, we can also gain insight into the advantages and disadvantages of their respective theories of knowledge more generally.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ca75a4dcaaf482699546364bdaa4ff44"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Philosophy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9e33e83783742d1d04a9a78e29a844c4" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Phenomenology of Mood and its Epistemic Significance for the Space of Reasons</unittitle><unitid>UA005.002.029.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Janick, Stephen P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7346bf9cc46eea9fe47d0163413641b1">In this paper I investigate the fundamental claim of John McDowell's seminal work \Mind and World\"--that experience is conceptual at its most basic layer. While I am sympathetic with his project of revising a naturalistic conception of human perception I highlight certain areas of his thought that remain unclear by the terms of his project. In so doing I aim to provide a critical interpretation of McDowell's work that focuses on the possibility of his accommodating a conception of perceptual experience that is theory-laden. Drawing on the historical-philosophical work of Thomas Kuhn and the existentialist phenomenology of Martin Heidegger I suggest a manner by which McDowell's theory of experience may incorporate theory-laden perception. What's more I analyze the surrealistic film work of Joseph Cornell using the aesthetic theoretical terms of Theodor Adorno and Heidegger's concept of mood to demonstrate a pre-reflective dimension of experience that is related to yet separate from conceptual thinking.

The approach of antitrust enforcement authorities related to such mergers focuses on how the post-merger market will differ from the pre-merger market. Economists have increasingly addressed this question using merger simulation models. These simulations use empirical estimates of key demand and supply parameters, as well as formal economic models of imperfect competition to predict the post-merger market. With these methods, one can analyze quantitatively how a given merger is likely to affect consumers and producers. With the use of a formal model, one can examine how the predictions for the post-merger market vary when key input parameters or behavioral assumptions are changed, providing insight into the robustness of the results. This paper uses merger simulation models to evaluate the recent merger of two of the three largest firms in the U.S. waste disposal industry, Allied Waste and Republic Services. The findings indicate that the merger is likely to be profitable but will lead to a consumer welfare loss if the merged firm???s cost savings are about 5% percent or less. However, if cost savings are larger, the simulation results indicate that the merger will increase total surplus, and for cost-savings rates above 12.3%, the industry price will decrease and consumer surplus will rise consistently.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6936ca53b6047c9532f4d6eb8cf5754d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_95388de9f055fe083c1288d7eb4bb0ec" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Growing Threat of Internet Piracy in the Movie Industry: The Effect of Rapid Pirated Leaks on Motion Picture Revenues</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.042.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Henning, Nicholas</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_bc4aa926f324cb27956ade780c226ae6">In 2005, the MPAA claimed that worldwide losses to movie piracy amounted to about $18.2 billion, with $6.1 billion of that missing revenue accounted for by MPAA affiliates alone. The difficulty in measuring piracy is that it is obviously illegal, making data collection and participant surveys skewed in results. In addition, the movie industry is a complex system, and any given movie has a large variability of success factors which amount to unpredictability in the expected revenue of motion pictures. This paper seeks to investigate how the speed of internet piracy affects industry revenues by creating a model for film revenue regressed against the number of days from theatrical release to first piracy leak, first screener leak, and first DVD leak, amongst several control variables. When including control variables, the impact of piracy is found to be negligible, particularly in comparison to the production budget variable. Without these controls, significance is
                found for days until first piracy leak and screener leak, implying the more days until first piracy leak the lower revenues will be and that more days until first screener leak leads to higher revenues, t(124)=-2.91, p&lt;.01, and t(124)=3.05, p&lt;.01. Finally, scatter plots of the data find that most films which end up making high worldwide revenues are pirated within the first week after theatrical release.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_882a539b50bbe7b4ac9ba0eb45c1b7b6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f24132ee80824a97cbba015f75bbfecc" level="item"><did><unittitle>The American Nightmare: Exploring the Foreclosure Crisis in Boston</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.043.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Herrmann, Jessica</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_73aef8bcc458dcf33e81288344d8b465">Using site evaluation information and neighborhood characteristics from the 2000 Census, the following paper analyzes the impact of various factors on the maintenance of bank-owned properties after foreclosure. There are a number of significant variables, including the appearance of the property being occupied on the date of the site evaluation and the rating for the area surrounding the property. Contrary to expectations, the number of foreclosures within an eighth of a mile of the property also has a positive, significant value, but its low standardized coefficient decreases the importance of this finding. In addition, research was conducted using both quantitative and qualitative measurements to determine the location of high concentrations of foreclosures within Census block groups during the Boston foreclosure crisis in the early 1990s and the current foreclosure crisis. This research used two density mapping strategies, one that counted the number of
                foreclosures in each Census block group and one that examined the number of foreclosures within a quarter mile radius of all 100-square meter cells in each Census block group, to analyze the density of foreclosures and found a consistent relationship between higher minority populations and a greater concentration of foreclosures during both foreclosure crises.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a203f64a62ef1900331faee48c73fcf3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f3937ce44c09cb285047061c87b787c7" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Impact of Random Tax Policy on Investment in Wind Power</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.044.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mazumdar, Jonathan B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7d35eaab498a089937e691a55ba0b1dc">This thesis considers the impact of tax policy uncertainty on firm level investment in wind power. I model the decision to invest as an irreversible investment with both price uncertainty and policy uncertainty. Tax policy uncertainty is introduced by a production tax credit that makes random discrete jumps. The model suggests that uncertain tax policy may decrease the time to investment and increase the level of investment as firms concentrate investment in high tax credit periods. Policy uncertainty may also lead to decreased government tax revenues and have negative effects on the wind power industry. Further work remains to solve the model numerically to determine the precise effects of policy uncertainty.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f8584228d325739f927d728f991be4e6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9f4322524325207225497f31194790a9" level="item"><did><unittitle>Life Events: Objective and Subjective Responses to the Business Cycle</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.045.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Porzecanski, Katia Julia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_abb8bab19aa7c8318fef63ac1a2ead2e">This study analyzes the relationship between the business cycle and objective and subjective responses to four major life events: abortion, crime, health and suicide. We measure the impact of the business cycle on objective responses by using quantitative data on abortion and live birth rates, crime rates, mortality rates, and suicide rates. We measure the impact of the business cycle on subjective responses by using survey data about attitudes towards abortion, fear of crime, self-assessed health condition, and attitudes about suicide. We find that abortion rates and live birth rates, violent crimes, and mortality are pro-cyclical, property crimes are counter-cyclical, and there is no significant relationship between the business cycle and suicide rates. We find that newspaper readership is a significant determinant in subjective responses. Agreement with abortion, fear of crime, and positive health assessments are pro-cyclical for individuals who do not read the
                newspaper, while all of these effects are negated for individuals who read the newspaper. Agreement with suicide, however, is pro-cyclical regardless of newspaper readership.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_548b7905c8cde0fb990386874a0d30e1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d1ff25f90edf21d3bfd31f907ffbfcbc" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Comparative Study of Antitrust Merger Laws in the US and the EU: Is Convergence Possible?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.046.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tewarie, Shrutih</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_588d9fc9a21c00b361aed3b4793e4dc4" label="Books [39090015513464b]" type="box">Volume 46</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6a3e10230ce2bd7c4f07c20f0dd75ceb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e13516edb35788bb2a7bb2a7489db563" level="item"><did><unittitle>Who Benefits from U.S. Food Aid?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.047.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Visek, Lauren E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_684e6246e7dd2f04ce20ece4626fe499">Using data on U.S. food aid shipments from 1960-2000, we utilize a regression using instrumental variables and fixed effects by country and commodity in a 2SLS regression.

The two-part hypothesis posits that the buyer's reputation and the factory's reputation both play a role in determining a factory's level of labor law compliance. A buyer with a substantial record of corporate social responsibility is likely to exert pressure on its supplier to maintain ethical standards in the workplace; the public disclosure of a factory's working conditions "which may enhance or tarnish a factory's reputation" is also likely to lead to higher levels of compliance. Better Factories Cambodia provided the compliance data, which was used in conjunction with primary data collected on firm and buyer characteristics. The exogenous change in the program's reporting format in 2006 allowed for a natural experiment regarding the impact of public disclosure. This research is intended to supplement the larger body of literature on personnel economics, which mainly focuses on wages and prices. The methodology in this thesis, however, investigates labor law compliance directly, using ordinary least squares regression to find correlations between the two reputation effects and retrogression on labor laws. The results show that both the buyer effect and the public disclosure effect have a negative correlation with retrogression, but the effects have opposite impacts on different types of compliance points. The conclusion incorporates directions for future research and a number of practical policy recommendations for the Better Factories Cambodia program.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_74754f4dd53a2f20c588db1dcef52b0b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2a49388af5c431d945a58cf8d4980ab9" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Impact of High Stakes Standardized Testing on High and Low Achieving School Districts: The Case of the MCAS</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.049.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Havdala, Robert J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d581a5d6267e8448bdbd5757782edf23">Ever since the passage of No Child Left Behind in 2002, high stakes testing has been at the forefront of the national education reform debate. Though these reforms are frequently meant to identify and help underperforming schools, there may be unintended effects on high performing districts.  Previous research on high stakes testing and high performing students has yielded mixed results. This study examines the impact of the Massachusetts high stakes testing scheme (MCAS) by analyzing high school dropout rates, future plans of high school seniors, and SAT results. I find slight evidence that the gap between high and low achieving school districts has widened and note that Massachusetts students have not been affected compared to national trends. I conclude that high stakes accountability seems to have had an insignificant, if not relatively negative, impact on low achieving district performance.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_69717949ee610ca54113f8b6d635ffa2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1ca4833d9ccc14cb85d9db06df8eba39" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Redistributive Effects of British Subsidies to Higher Education</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.050.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mishkin, Elizabeth R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0f7e4c5c6878ebe9c450b92cbc3c6801">Like many forms of government spending, higher education subsidies redistribute income by using tax revenues to reduce the cost to students of attending college or university.  Such subsidies are desirable because they make higher education affordable for students from lower income backgrounds, with important implications for equity and social mobility.  However, when non-financial constraints deter low-income students from enrolling in college or university, untargeted higher education subsidies largely benefit individuals who are not only from higher income backgrounds, but whose degrees will likely provide them with above-average earnings in the future.  This effect is particularly significant in countries like the United Kingdom, characterized by high income inequality, low social mobility, and enormous untargeted subsidies to higher education.  Following a 2006 analysis by William Johnson for the United States, this paper explores the redistributive properties of British subsidies to higher education.  Focusing on the income of graduates and their non-graduate peers rather than of their parents, the experience-earnings profiles of a cohort of English and Welsh 17- to 25-year-olds are projected.  From this information, the average net present value of the taxes paid and education benefits received is calculated for each lifetime income decile in order to provide a picture of the redistributive effects of the current system of higher education funding in the UK.  The results show that, within this cohort, lifetime income deciles seven, eight, and nine are net beneficiaries of the higher education finance system, while the bottom six deciles, along with decile ten, pay more in taxes to higher education than they receive in direct benefits.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_dc33dca4fb75ae4c88fbc6f5f0f72cf8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7dad2c1073d6d5e92d6fff5c16b16dd1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Does Money Grow on Trees?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.051.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Coyne, David J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_03c99bbd90a9496c71c6a1c08f112336">This analysis uses threshold regressions to reveal three possible nonlinear trees to describe cross-country growth data, and uses BART to test for parameter heterogeneity.

Research on the foreclosure crisis has so far focused on single family, owner-occupied dwellings. It has neglected another important segment of the housing stock: small, multi-family rental structures. This research looks at how owners of these properties have been affected by the crisis and, in particular, how an owner's occupancy status influences the probability of foreclosure. To determine these relationships, I track owners' experiences for a sample of homes in Massachusetts from 1998 to 2009, using data from the Massachusetts Registry of Deeds, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), and the US Census. I find that ownership of a multifamily property is correlated with higher foreclosure rates than ownership of single-family properties; owners of two family properties are nearly twice as likely to experience foreclosure and owners of three family properties are more than 2.5 times more likely. Owner occupants are more likely to experience foreclosure than investor owners, although financial characteristics, such as loan type, have much greater impacts the probability of foreclosure. Moreover, between 1998 and 2009 I find significant changes in the correlation between owner occupancy, property type and foreclosure.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_898b5b080e143bb6562909fb5d608aff"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0a6bdc8e6765591bd3bfef4270e10e19" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Economic Legacy of Population Transfers in Socialist and Post-Socialist Czechoslovakia</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.053.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fulwiler, Maria</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b6eddcb9c1324ceb430daf6a44c77b40">After the close of the Second World War, the European Continent experienced the largest demographic upheaval in modern history. In an act of retribution for the crimes of Nazi Germany, Central and Eastern European nations expelled more than 10 million ethnic Germans from their lands. Czechoslovakia, one of the most active participants in this postwar population transfer, uprooted almost 3 million Germans from her border regions and sent them to Allied occupied Germany. This thesis investigates the economic consequences of this dramatic population change. The border regions of Czechoslovakia housed some of Central and Eastern Europe's most important industry: much of this industry was owned or operated by ethnic Germans. The industry of Czechoslovakia became increasingly important as the Cold War set in and the demands of state planners enflamed the wounds already persistent in the de-populated border regions. The combination of state planning demands and the loss of a skilled and integral minority group shaped the economic development of the border regions in socialist and post-socialist Czechoslovakia.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f38180cbbff10d3583628c1f055c4d84"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Economics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c2d1ca355f906965f36d36dfd158ffe1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Grandmother's Pension and Its Effect on Youth Behavior: Evidence from the Cape Panel Study</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.054.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Russman, Adam Seth</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f2499931d070a080de1f104e45f7cc49">Vast amounts of time, money and resources have been devoted to studying the sexual behaviors of young adults in South Africa in recent years. Teen pregnancy rates are relatively high in South Africa compared to equally developed countries and the spread of HIV/AIDS is of grave concern. Using the South Africa's State Old-Age Pension program as an exogenous shock to household income, I analyze the relationship between sexual risk taking and income. Using data from the Cape Area Panel Study and ordinary least squares, fixed effects modeling, I find that grandfathers' pensions have no effect on risky behavior while grandmothers' pensions directly impact risk-taking behaviors. The effects of grandmothers' pensions on sexual activity, condom use and teen pregnancy vary based on the race and gender of the young adult. But the pension measurements potentially suffer from measurement error and are endogenous. To address this issue, I use instrumental variables approach using age-eligibility dummies as instruments for pension recipients. I find that the pension indicators likely suffer from classical measurement error. I still find that grandfathers' pensions have no effect on sexual risk taking. On the other hand, grandmothers' pensions increase overall sexual activity by 0.3%, condom usage by 3.1%, and teen pregnancy by 5.6%. The effects differ by the gender and race of the young adult due to differences in initial income levels and the power structure within South African households.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2b4d459680ec03dcdc79bd72a6206314"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Sexuality</subject><subject source="local">Economic conditions</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c744832e0bbdfde485942b435d3f042b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Exchange Rates and Foreign Direct Investment Into China</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.055.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lo, Doris Y.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5d4d1ff770ab3c2b06a035a391f3f69e">International controversy surrounding the Chinese exchange rate regime implies far-reaching impacts of policy decisions.

I show that when the market is contestable the local welfare remains unchanged in the wake of a big box firm's entry.  In contrast, when the market is incontestable, local welfare decreases in the wake of big box entry due to a decline in both consumer and producer surplus.  In both cases though, the global surplus always increases.  The before- and after- big box entry comparison of local welfare will hold for any symmetric equilibrium whether local firms are forward-looking and anticipate the later big-box entry or myopic, as I assume.  Under the myopic assumption however, local retail entry is excessive relative to the optimal case.  Therefore, since the anticipation of the "big box" firm's later arrival would depress this excessive entry, that welfare conclusion does not necessarily mean that big box entry should be blocked.  Instead, the first-best solution would be a tax-and-transfer scheme that recognizes that "big box" entry is welfare-enhancing globally and then makes sure that everyone benefits.  If such a policy is not possible however, then legislation to prohibit "big box" entry may be a sensible second-best policy for regions facing that prospect.  A major implication of my analysis is that local retail firms will exit at the time of the big box firm's entry.  It is this loss in competitive pressure that could make local consumers as well as local producers worse off.  I test this implication using panel data from 1977-92, along with both a fixed-effects and Instrumental Variables (IV) approach to test the impact of Wal-Mart's entry into a regional market on the number of retail firms operating in that market.  As predicted, the number for local firms always declines noticeably in the wake of big box entry.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8330a530c98ad7132a5022cf3c6ffbe2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Industrial organization</subject><subject source="local">Competition</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d8b4cc14704665b04ab9b984845875c0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Stadium Subsidies, Public Choice, and Property Values: A Test of the Homevoter Hypothesis in King County, Washington</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.058.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Miner, Kimberly A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_37cdc41ba22f864741bc410d94a5c13d">This paper examines the applicability of William Fischel's "homevoter hypothesis" to the 1997 referendum on subsidizing a new stadium for the National Football League's Seattle Seahawks.  According to Fischel's hypothesis, homeowners vote for proposals that will increase their property's value and against those that will decrease their property's value.  If the homevoter hypothesis explains voter behavior in this instance, then voters who perceive that their home value will increase – via "noisy signals" from sales in their local neighborhood – will be more likely to support the proposal.  This paper has two empirical steps: a hedonic analysis to quantify the stadium's impact on property values and an analysis that connects these price effects to voting results in King County, Washington.  The results indicate a very small negative stadium price effect, but do not find a strong correlation between this effect and actual voting results.  They yield underwhelming support for the homevoter hypothesis but add valuable depth to literature on this topic.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d75fd96c15de1c0b2e91b074950e7aa6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Local government</subject><subject source="local">Stadiums</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_79299708441318ee0e4d42925dc32898" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Case for Strategic Paranoia</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.059.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Clegg, Liam F.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9c9589223e4fae4ced3d9cc79f56ac57">I argue that the thrill of winning, which I call Endogenous Reinforcement, is adaptive in that it prevents agents from adopting pure strategies in competitive environments, which would leave them open to exploitation.

However, a good (bad) performance in the first 2 rounds reduces (increases) risk-taking  behavior in the third round or changes in risk-taking behavior in the 3rd round, relative to the first two rounds. We also examine the rare cases of rematches, and find that while performance in the original fight is a good predictor of the outcome and performance in a rematch, the actual outcome of the original fight is not.

Both their effectiveness in attracting investment and their ability to impact the wider economy are debated. One such intervention designates an area of land, sometimes an entire city, as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ): an area to be provided with fiscal incentives, less stringent regulation, lower levels of corruption, and improved infrastructure. The long-term goal of such interventions is to provide a jump-start to growth in the wider economy. In a number of Asian countries including China and Thailand, SEZs have been identified as successful tools for increasing export production and attracting foreign investment.   In 2000, India adopted an explicit SEZ policy as a successor to and expansion of its earlier Export Processing Zone (EPZ) policy.  This paper explores the case of the Indian SEZ's.  The Indian SEZ policy has been surrounded by controversy, with claims that it has had little or no effect.  To date no formal evaluation has been carried out. This paper aims to identify measurable evidence of the outcomes to date of that policy. It reviews the available qualitative data on their effects and explores evidence of their quantitative impact on output, exports and agglomeration (employment) in the SEZs and in the states and districts surrounding them.  This thesis uses three models in an attempt to answer some key questions: What characterizes the locations chosen by the Indian government for the SEZs? Has the SEZ policy led to further economies of agglomeration? For example, what proportion, if any, of employment growth in the surrounding states and districts is attributable to the SEZs? Are firms choosing to locate in SEZs because of their special attributes or would they have located there anyway? Ultimately, in what way, if at all, has the SEZ policy been effective?  I first evaluate the increase in employment associated with the SEZ. By comparing SEZ employment growth to that of their districts and states, this model assesses the proportion of city growth associated with the incentives found specifically in the SEZ.  The second model explores interactions between the SEZs presence and exogenous factors likely to affect urbanization rates and foreign direct investment, including literacy, industrialization and financial infrastructure. The third model examines variables that may explain the selection of specific locations for SEZs.   I find that the marginal effect of the SEZs on rates of urbanization and growth of employment in the surrounding areas is small at best.  The qualitative surveys portray a failure to implement the policy effectively in India. My quantitative findings are consistent with that finding (Aggarwal, 2004).</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6512a2fad60c9fdb7b595f7cd5c414c9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a9e792495555f1242d8583bbf8b80073" level="item"><did><unittitle>Obesity and Poverty in America</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.063.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Langer, Elizabeth M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ee531a23f8eb2aa134789af3d8b2de59">This paper focuses on the relationship between various poverty indicators and their effects on obesity at the state level from 1995 to 2009.

While it is very likely that some price increase will occur, some of the increase in demand for corn will be partially met by an increase in supply. The exact impact on price is not immediately obvious due to the complex nature of the corn market. This paper sets out to estimate price impacts by modeling this complex market. As the quantity and price of goods are endogenous within markets, three stage least estimators are used. By constructing a model incorporating the supply and demand equations of corn and various related agricultural products, the effects of ethanol production and pro-ethanol government policies on the price of agricultural goods is estimated.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6d4d729b8e7a4aeba59f7fdd0174bea0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_a59955e11a14876dc6d6d9089a520ed7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Winning the Lottery: Measuring the Effect of Changes in the NBA Draft Structure on Competitive Balance and Attendance</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.065.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Weidenbaum, Adam S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_36ef523a070bb1304a11458a57595393">Professional sports are often thought of as a game, but in reality they are also a business.  Like most other business, professional sports leagues are trying to maximize their profits.  While there are many components that affect a league_�_s profitability, one aspect is the competitive balance of the league.  Studies have generally shown that a greater level of parity in a sports league generates greater attendance and therefore greater league profits.  Even as this is the case, professional leagues have a very difficult time creating a more competitive atmosphere.  Some teams will inherently have more economic resources at their disposal, either because of a wealthy owner, a strong location, or simply a long-standing history that has spawned a large fan base.  Nonetheless, leagues utilize any means they can of affecting a more balanced environment.  But how effective are their efforts?
\
In this paper, I analyze the effect that rule changes in the draft procedure have had on competitive balance in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  To do this, I look at the changes in the NBA draft, including the adoption of the draft lottery and the weighted draft lottery, and look at the impact those changes had on the competitive balance in the league.  From there, I will look at the effect that these changes had on overall league attendance for lottery teams as opposed to non lottery teams.  I find that some models show that the introduction of the lottery led to a significant decrease in competitive balance and most models show that the change to weighted lottery led to a significant decrease in balance.  Attendance does appear to have been affected differently for teams participating in the lottery versus those not in the lottery.

The emergence of foreign competition has had a profound impact on domestic firms across industries and nations. Yet the precise nature of these effects differs by industry. In some cases, e.g., U.S. textiles, the emergence of foreign competition has led to a dramatic reduction of domestic output as consumers have switched to foreign goods. In others, e.g., Canadian wine, foreign competitions effect has instead spurred domestic innovation and quality improvement. The U.S. full-size pickup truck market presents a natural experiment regarding the market impact of foreign competition. Full-size trucks fall into one of two size categories, based on capacity. Within the U.S., foreign producers have focused on only the lighter duty segment, so that reviewing the differences between the two market segments permits identification of the effects that such competition has had. For this purpose, I use a hedonic approach to construct constant quality price indexes for both market segments in the U.S. between 1992 and 2012 and compare the movement of these indexes over time. The results demonstrate a relative increase in truck quality in the segment with foreign competition beginning at the time such competition emerged in 2000, but little effect on absolute market prices.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c70617b60ea1c9affd5f0cb475d33b06"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Economics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f6639639aa46a62444bbcb73585e5001" level="item"><did><unittitle>Does the Market Beat Midas Conditional on Federal Reserve Policy?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.068.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sammon, Marco C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2c5074edb02b3ff140120334553e093c">This paper examines algorithms implemented in MATLAB  that can be used to solve systems of Black-Scholes equations for implied volatility and implied risk-free rate.  These algorithms were run on a dataset of almost 400,000 call options traded between 2003 and 2012.  After adjusting for volatility skew, the options are re-priced using these model-implied parameters in the Black-Scholes equation.  Moneyness, time to expiration and the size of the bid-ask spread, are then examined to explain why market prices and model prices differ over time.  This paper finds that call options far from expiration usually have Black-Scholes prices that exceed market prices, while those with large bid-ask spreads have, on average, market prices that exceed model prices.  This paper also finds that, given recent developments in financial markets, including increased volatility and investor risk aversion, the Black-Scholes model may no longer accurately price call options.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3ab22dce60cb81726ac72f5bc4eeff16"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Economics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2e69ce47dffd95007652bdd8ba8f4ed2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Government Inside Information and Debt Signaling: Evidence from Consumer and Business Confidence</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.069.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hirata, Sean C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_dca3648db55f23e416c83619c7cc03b2">My research begins with a new theoretical model that applies the idea of debt signaling to the public sector. It suggests that due to constraints on the government's time in power, spending as much as possible in the current period is attractive as long as the government doesn't default in the future. Therefore, a strong projection of economic growth would lead to an increase in deficit spending in the current period. Using U.S. public debt to GDP ratio and measures of consumer and business confidence, I look at whether an increase in debt is taken to be a signal of future growth, as it is in the private sector. To do this, I estimate two versions of a two variable VAR model, one for consumer confidence and one for business confidence. In both models, I find evidence that supports the theoretical model with a positive significant impact of debt on confidence.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_65f4d3c039429450fd80f80a648ff0c4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Economics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2d542126cb41fcfeb00ca1c4ca9976dc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Do Increases in Income Affect Averting Behavior?

Without strict environmental standards and enforcement, it is often up to the individual to protect himself from environmental degradation.  Per capita income is also low in developing countries, and  individuals must prioritize their expenditures. We may expect that, as people get richer, their averting behavior, actions taken to mitigate environmental harm, will increase, but given limited income, this may not be the case.  In this paper, I study the changes in averting behaviors, such as water treatment and cooking fuel choice, when a household's income increases.  Using data from the pilot phase of Nicaragua's Social Protection Network conditional cash transfer program that was designed as a randomized controlled experiment, I use a difference-in-difference model to study the effects of the cash transfers.  I find that, while there is no effect with cooking fuel choice, there is a significant, positive program treatment effect for drinking water treatment.  The water treatment effect is similar in magnitude to the program treatment effects for food expenditure, health, and education variables.  The results indicate the poor in developing countries are concerned about environmental protection and its implications, but that greater emphasis is put on lower cost areas in which there are more immediate health implications.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a227e8a20e259728d387948f4eea526d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Economics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9896e50594b1e03c47b48bfea27f688e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Conflict and Urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.071.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wolff, Jessica S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0896c70ae2c4a70c04c23195db998648">The countries of sub-Saharan Africa have recently experienced both the highest rates of urbanization and the greatest number of conflicts globally.

As is the case with other public health concerns, policymakers and academics have looked to the role that education can serve in preventing the spread of the disease. However, despite education's usual role as a preventative factor, or social vaccine, against contagion, within the discourse on the HIV and AIDS pandemic education's association with infection is contested. Additionally, in many analyses done relating education to HIV status, education is endogenous to the model, leading to biased results. In this study I provide a background of the established theories that examine education's relation with HIV status. Filling the void created by endogeneity issues that restrict past studies, I use an instrumental variable regression to model the relationship between education and HIV status in Zambia. Using the 2007 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey data, I utilize the exogenous shock to educational attainment created by the Zambian Basic Education Sub-Sector Investment Program's free primary education policy (2002), to instrument for education in my model. I find that within my total sample, education has a significant and negative effect on HIV status. However, when the instrumental variable regression is run by gender, it is only the males who display a significant and negative relationship, while the correlation between education and HIV is insignificant for females. Based on these findings, I suggest that HIV prevention policy may be best directed towards investing in universal primary education, initiatives that target women and girls, information campaigns and sexual health curricula in schools.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9f09ccb748409c5f8151366c9bea3b5c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Economics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_df6810d8640e296c853b37ca6fac9f64" level="item"><did><unittitle>An Explanation of Social Norms as Illustrated by Tipping</unittitle><unitid>UA005.003.073.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Glass, Benjamin M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_82be6fc66c079a9bc649f1ccaef0e5e6">A process of the development of social norms is described in which norms develop through a process of signaling between people due to the time it takes to make a decision.

In the first hypothesis, teams draft more players from schools with high-caliber players due to the availability heuristic. This bias is found and is shown to be detrimental to teams. The second hypothesis contends that the availability heuristic will lead teams to overdraft from their local
                                state. Analysis shows that between a fourth and a third of NFL teams draft local players too often, but this does not have any negative effect on performance. The final hypothesis argues that teams will use a mental representation of an NFL player when drafting, even if the mental representation is flawed. This hypothesis is confirmed for quarterbacks, where teams miss a key signal, but is found to be false for offensive skill players, who teams draft based on the
                                correct cues.

The proposed theory contends that, in the absence of an incentivizing piece-rate wage, workers will be subject to increased levels of verbal abuse to deter shirking behavior. If it is demonstrated that verbal exhortation leads to high levels of productivity from a worker, then it could possibly be the case that firms are profit-maximizing in their decision to
                                pay workers hourly and take a tolerant stance toward verbal abuse (contingent on the degree of presumed disutility workers suffer from being abused). Alternately, if verbal abuse is found to have negative profitability implications, firms would be acting sub-optimally and would have an incentive to better monitor the abuse. Results from analysis of firm incentive structures confirm that supervisors do use verbal abuse as a supplementary motivational tool. However,
                                results also refute the possibility for a business case, demonstrating that verbal abuse has detrimental implications for firm profits, both by negatively impacting worker productivity and generating a costly compensating differential.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7c59eb696b2352649aa346a32a3437fe"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In urban and rural India, in the 1990s, poverty declined and school attendance increased. However, studies find that in areas in which employment is concentrated in industries exposed to larger reductions in tariffs, poverty decreased less, and attendance increased less than in areas less exposed to tariff reductions. I take advantage of the variation in pre-reform employment composition within districts, and differential rates of tariff decline by industry, to identify the impact of tariff cuts on total years of schooling. I find that in districts more exposed to liberalization, one specific subgroup is significantly and positively affected. For women in rural areas in the lowest 30% of the income distribution, tariff declines are associated with an increase in average years of schooling. In districts experiencing the average decline in district
                tariffs of 5.5%, average years of education for poor rural women increased by almost a year. Other demographic groups are not significantly affected by tariff reforms. I find that the most likely mechanism for this result is tariff and poverty-induced increases in female labor force participation, which increases relative female income in low socioeconomic status households. This could increase girls' returns to education, and increase women's household bargaining power, which could reduce the gender education gap.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">India--Commercial policy--20th century.</geogname><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Because advertising contributes to consumer habit formation and advertising targeting children is particularly effective, limiting children's exposure to advertisements may result in short-term and long-term consumer change. In 1980, Quebec implemented the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), which banned advertising targeting children in order to protect consumers that are supposedly less able to make informed decisions. Household expenditure survey data is used to empirically estimate a causal relationship between the CPA and household toy consumption in Quebec. I reveal that Quebec households with relatively large annual expenditures on toys experience a significant decrease in toy expenditure as a result of the CPA, but the decrease does not occur for over 10 years after the ban's implementation. Quebec households that have
                relatively small annual toy expenditure experience a persistent decrease in toy expenditure as a result of the CPA within four years of the ban's implementation. The empirical result provides support for the view that spending more on toys may cause deeper habit formation, which is more difficult to change by removing targeted advertising. In order to measure potential welfare changes caused by the CPA, we additionally provide an original model of advertising with peer effects by modifying a model developed by Dixit and Norman (1978). Using this model, we put forth an argument grounded in psychology that predicts banning advertising to children may have increased welfare in Quebec's toy industry.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The physical proximity between firms increases productivity through input sharing, labor pooling, matching and knowledge spillovers. Jacobs (1969), Porter (1990), and Marshal-Arrow-Romer (1890-1962-1986) have stressed the importance of knowledge spillovers in an urban agglomeration as dynamic externalities that generate economic growth. However, these theories differ in the role of local competition, city specialization and diversity in generating growth. Glaeser et al. (1992) tested the different theories of dynamic externalities using U.S. data and found that city diversity and local competition generate growth. Replicating the Glaeser et al. (1992) model and data from 56 Mexican metropolitan areas, I find that city diversity and local competition have a positive effect on growth, whereas geographic specialization hindered job creation in

Key elements of the reform include provisions directed at extending coverage to low-income individuals and a mandate requiring nearly all residents to be enrolled in a qualifying health plan. While past literature illustrated the impacts of the reform on access to care, preventative care, and hospitalization, little research has been done to isolate the disparate effects the reform had on individuals earning below 300% of the Federal Poverty Level, who received subsidies for health plans. This paper not only identifies the greater impact on this subpopulation, but also focuses on specific health behaviors, a relatively novel field of study in health economics. This paper makes a unique attempt to identify the relationship between the reform and improvements in the health behaviors of low-income individuals in Massachusetts. I use a
                difference-in-differences strategy that compares observations in Massachusetts during the implementation and post- implementation periods of reform to observations before reform and observations in comparison states. A difference-in-difference-in-differences strategy is used to isolate the differential impact on low-income individuals within Massachusetts. Using the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS), I show that the reform had its greatest impact in low-income individuals in several measures of access to care as well as health behaviors.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

neighborhoods of Santiago, Chile and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil? I propose that in Rio, structures of classical clientelism, residents' associations and politicians exchanging votes for services, continue to exist, although weakened by the influence of drug traffickers. Furthermore, the availability of national and international private support for grassroots NGOs reduces dependence of community organizations on local governments to address many local needs. In Santiago, the elimination of old organizational structures by the military dictatorship and the increased decentralization of government have allowed municipal governments to monopolize support of local-level organization. Municipality provision of support and services to these communities while denying any expectation of a return creates an implicit clientelism based not on acts of exchange, but on networks formed between municipal officials and local power brokers. I examine the nature of these regimes and organizational structures based on in-depth interviews with social organization leaders and founders of grassroots NGOs in the communities of Nova Holanda in Rio and La Legua in Santiago.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_50bf410dc560192888194b8aca1779e5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in International Relations</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b42896cc0eea8c76a8d46a58f9260cfd" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Red Flag: The Collapse of the Urban Chinese Medical Care System since the Economic Reforms of the early 1980s</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.047.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bach, Aliza</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_68b0bdc7eb5fdb2c201ec2a8adee94e0">The Urban Chinese Medical Care System has been in a state of decline starting with the economic reform period in mainland China in the early 1980s.

How does this unevenly transplanted iNGO regime, including its discourse, projects, culture, and social and political agendas interface with survivors' community transitional justice process?  What unintended, new arrangements in power, culture and social order grow out of these interfaces, or as anthropologist Alice Tsing refers to it, what frictions occur?  My study focuses specifically on the frictional interfaces between NGO peacebuilding programs and survivors' expressions of forgiveness for perpetrators of atrocities in Gulu District.

However, for many countries in the region, intra-regional trade (a key indicator of regional economic integration,) remains at a disappointingly low level.  By investigating the African regional bank Ecobank, this thesis seeks to identify a new regional actor that may be able to impact regional integration in West Africa.  The paper will combine literature of 'old regionalism', 'new regionalisms', and the role of the financial sector development in economic growth in order to gain a holistic perspective of how a financial institution may emulate a regional actor.  This empirically-based study combines both quantitative and qualitative analyses to identify the Mechanisms by which Ecobank may affect the regionalization process.  This thesis finds that the presence of Ecobank in a pair of West African countries leads to an increase in trade among the economies of that country pair over time.  Another important finding is that the bank's dual mission of generating profits and fostering regional integration is integral to its capacity as a regional actor.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7d4690b4cafb56566a1d908bacf1c69c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in International Relations</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a65a45946026f41d504c42c44e892dd2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Moving Gyeongseong: Korean Reaction to Changes in the Urban Landscape of Colonial Seoul in the 1920s</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.050.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Song, Jane Ga-Young</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6a1f4b183a4a07c26c2965d006df1a27">The 1920s building boom in Gyeongseong (the name of Seoul during the Japanese occupation of 1910-1945) created a modern geography that had not existed before. Korean residents traveled along the widened roads that connected all the major city monuments, absorbed their new environment sculpted by imposing western-style buildings, and congregated in public places ("officially sanctioned social places") that were supposed to turn them into dutiful colonial subjects.  Modernization of Gyeongseong's physical space was an integral part of the colonial discourse; the colonial government hoped that the burgeoning modernity of the colony would gain Koreans' compliance, or at least passive acceptance, of the colonial order.  My research found that Gyeongseong's immediate physical spaces "landmarks symbolizing colonial power, parks, and downtown commercial streets" entertained, impressed, and attracted urban Koreans, but they also revealed the extent of cultural, political, and economic discrimination that Koreans faced in a city that no longer belonged to them.  I will argue that this ambiguous, uneven, and contradicting response from the everyday physical space of Korean colonial modernism was a critical one; the dissenting voices contributed to the pervading nationalistic mood of the time period.  The 1920s is generally seen as Japan's most "successful" period of colonization, for its modernizing efforts and more lax policies led to the "most effective form of manipulation" in Korea.  Nevertheless, in hindsight it is evident that the 1920s had many contradictions and largely failed to produce "model colonial subjects" even in Gyeongseong's small middle class who welcomed modernity in Korea.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_788c90052506b63c3d77fd1503f1ae04"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in International Relations</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6775441492f8d3d17f5b127252888113" level="item"><did><unittitle>Old Problems, New solution: The Role of Democratization in U.S. Foreign Policy in the Middle East</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.051.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nisetich, Alexander S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0394119a15b1d21281b3ab840221c532">An increased emphasis on democracy promotion in the Middle East over the past decade has returned few positive results for the United States.  Originally inspired to foster democratization by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the George W. Bush administration failed to transfer its rhetoric on democracy to effective policy.  After setbacks to the so-called freedom agenda in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian Territories, democracy promotion was essentially dismissed as a pipe dream.  However, the Middle East is possibly in greater need of political reform now than ever before.  Growing radicalism and years of conflict and instability have left the area in a turmoil that cannot be alleviated by the corrupt, autocratic leaders that govern with no popular support or legitimacy.  In order to retain the favorable position the United States occupies in the Middle East, policymakers must now be concerned with the internal politics of Middle Eastern states.  The entrenched autocratic regimes currently in place are entirely inadequate to meet the challenges of the region today.  The most effective way to address these challenges is to promote political and economic liberalization in the region with the ultimate goal of democratization.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_23977c838c481f3b51c7930cc87cc3d8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in International Relations</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a9e21d2d34830e5317500f1dfd143785" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Cold War and International Political Influences on War Memory in Postwar Japan and Germany</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.052.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Banks, Corey J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5480e77ef0e9a96a21ae0189891fa0e2">This paper is a comparative study of the postwar legacy of war crimes committed by Japan and Germany during World War II.

Many scholars have predicted that these reforms would have destabilized China during this period. These scholars were informed by the collapse of the former Soviet Union following the introduction of similar fiscal decentralization reforms. However, China was able to pull back from the brink of political instability to remain politically stable. Why was China able to remain politically stable in the aftermath of the fiscal decentralization reforms and did the fiscal decentralization reforms contribute to the political stability of China from 1979 to 1993?  There has been no direct, extensive analysis of the relationship between fiscal decentralization and social stability in China or the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during this period. My thesis addresses this gap in the literature by testing two hypotheses: (i) fiscal decentralization strengthened social stability through increasing government expenditure on social control instruments such as the media and the People's Armed Police Force (PAP); and (ii) fiscal decentralization strengthened the legitimacy of the CCP through promoting economic growth and creating a political buy-in effect. My findings indicate that both hypotheses are disconfirmed. Fiscal decentralization did not enable China to pull back from the brink of political instability from 1979 to 1993.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6490d3396dd0d79e158d152f44d66aa9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in International Relations</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3854cea796f87f86bd4739ec13c707c1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Moving Gyeongseong: Korean Reaction to Changes in the Urban Landscape of Colonial Seoul in the 1920s</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.054.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Ga-Young Song, Jane</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_323ac2ae7069400d1262e30a205b33dc">The 1920s building boom in Gyeongseong (the name of Seoul during the Japanese occupation of 1910-1945) created a modern geography that had not existed before. Korean residents traveled along the widened roads that connected all the major city monuments, absorbed their new environment sculpted by imposing western-style buildings, and congregated in public places ('officially sanctioned social places') that were supposed to turn them into dutiful colonial subjects.  Modernization of Gyeongseong's physical space was an integral part of the colonial discourse; the colonial government hoped that the burgeoning modernity of the colony would gain Koreans' compliance, or at least passive acceptance, of the colonial order.  My research found that Gyeongseong's immediate physical spaces' landmarks symbolizing colonial power, parks, and downtown commercial streets—entertained, impressed, and attracted urban Koreans, but they also revealed the extent of cultural, political, and economic discrimination that Koreans faced in a city that no longer belonged to them.  I will argue that this ambiguous, uneven, and contradicting response from the everyday physical space of Korean colonial modernism was a critical one; the dissenting voices contributed to the pervading nationalistic mood of the time period.  The 1920s is generally seen as Japan's most 'successful' period of colonization, for its modernizing efforts and more lax policies led to the 'most effective form of manipulation' in Korea.  Nevertheless, in hindsight it is evident that the 1920s had many contradictions and largely failed to produce 'model colonial subjects' even in Gyeongseong's small middle class who welcomed modernity in Korea</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_61a2bb834fabbeb00e6d0f11396c2f4c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in International Relations</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_dd7be52325679f6c481a8cdc7f53725e" level="item"><did><unittitle>An Examination of the Relationship Between Campaign Finance Corruption and Threats to National Security</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.055.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brown, Rachel H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_39946d65a9c23fcbd2ffbad3218b8d94">In September 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton answered a question posed to her about the social and political consequences of corruption and poor governance in Afghanistan with an unexpected twist. 'Corruption is as big a national security threat as I can imagine,' she stated, proceeding to note that, 'We've never posed it in quite that way before, but this is how I am seeing it'(Clinton, 2009). While the effects of corruption on economic development and, to a lesser extent, political institutions, have long been debated, Clinton's conception of corruption as a threat to the security of the United States demonstrates an evolving understanding of the consequences of corruption and the need for a better understanding of the relationship between corruption and security. My thesis takes a small step towards understanding the connections between corruption and security threats by asking which characteristics of campaign finance-related corruption make it more or less likely to have a strong correlation with security threats. I use a comparative case study of three Central American countries combined with a more in-depth examination of two election cycles in Kenya to explore the relationships between specific measures and types of campaign finance-related corruption and security threats. I focus on the threats of powerful violent criminal organization and domestic political violence, and I test three hypotheses in an attempt to answer whether there is a relationship between political campaign finance-related corruption and these security threats based on the prevalence of corruption, level on which corruption occurs, and the competitive or cooperative nature of that corruption. I conclude that there is a possible positive correlation between the prevalence of corruption and the level of security threat, and identify important variables for future consideration. The study shows that different sets of variables may be required in order to understand how campaign finance-related corruption relates to powerful violent criminal organizations versus how it relates to political violence, and that results may vary across regions. Specifically, it is important to understand in greater detail the level on which corruption occurs as it relates to violent criminal organizations, while levels of inter-elite competition surrounding campaign finance-related corruption appears to have a relationship with domestic political violence. Finally, I draw conclusions about methodological issues regarding the operationalization of my variables and propose solutions to these issues.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_39a369a2f8dec1f772a26a066708466f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Africa and the New World</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_844d46f3d3fdaac7927d61815e7cdc08" level="item"><did><unittitle>No Sword, No Purse, No Power: The International Court of Justice in International Relations</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.056.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Boulos, Anna M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5188884e130bb100a80b404434c206e9">The power of domestic judiciaries to influence national governance has led to academic and political speculation about the role of international law in regulating international relations. This intersection between international law (IL) and international relations (IR) is a relatively new, albeit particularly relevant area of study, given that IR theories may have predictive power in identifying the ability of international courts to influence international politics. For example, in the field of international relations, realists assert that international law is not a primary factor in state behavior, whereas constructivists and liberals believe international law can temper the anarchic nature of international politics. Similarly, in international law theory, skeptics believe international law will always be subordinate to international politics; but optimists believe it can govern state behavior. Using these, and other assumptions from IR and IL theories, this thesis investigates whether the International Court of Justice (ICJ) actively influences state behavior, and under which circumstances the Court is more/les influential. Specifically, by sampling 56 ICJ cases, this thesis examines variation in the Court's influence based on the size of the litigating states, material interests of the case, norm type, and source of law. The findings suggest there is variation among these variables in terms of predicting ICJ influence; with litigant disparity and material interests being most strongly, and negatively, correlated with the influence of the Court. More research is needed before affirming the regulative role of international law in state behavior.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_373952652294945eca075615d410c591"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International law</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><corpname source="local">International Court of Justice</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_119b31d07881a1bdae829d5905b60cd0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Taking Responsibility: Conflict Transformation and the Loyalist Paramilitaries of Northern Ireland</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.057.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sloan, Brittany Ilyssa</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e9d3baa6d8fd7df085d76733717e8de9">Since the Troubles, Northern Ireland's Protestant loyalist paramilitary organizations, the Ulster Defense Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force, have started on a road of fundamental change in pursuit of sustainable peace.  Intrinsic to this process has been the theory of conflict transformation, which has become loyalist gospel; however, a means of assessing the extent to which the loyalist paramilitaries are adhering to this creed remains limited.  Built on the seminal work of scholar John Paul Lederach and on the loyalists' own doctrine of "sharing responsibility," this research establishes a framework to assess the extent to which the loyalist paramilitaries are engaging in conflict transformation.  This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the loyalist initiatives within the tripartite framework of restructuring relationships, building capacity, and reconceptualizing norms for conflict transformation and analyzes each in accordance with three indicators of taking responsibility – behaving correctly, being accountable, and acting independently.  This process elucidates not only what the loyalists are doing to in support of conflict transformation, but also the degree of their success.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_18401f944c71115f7eefeaf94edb42b5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Peace-building</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5b37d92397b25f68f17bc700c3490b1c" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Two-Level Game of Strategic Euroscepticism</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.058.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Attewell, David N.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5bc44646b56c5831dff18858df02c3ac">At the heart of any federal polity lies a contestation of authority between the federal and state level. However, economist Gary Richardson made a key observation about the incongruous way in which this dynamic manifests itself in American budgetary politics. He found that even though red states are skeptical of government spending and federal authority in general, they are consistently net benefactors from the federal budget, while blue states are net contributors. Further investigation by journalists revealed that red state politicians were pursuing a strategy of federal-skepticism at both levels of the two-level game: attacking federal spending in the abstract, while courting it on the local level to maximize electoral advantage. I chose to examine the European Union to see if there was evidence, parallel with the US case, of strategic Euroscepticism associated with benefits from the EU budget.  My thesis combined both quantitative and qualitative measures to test this relationship. Quantitatively, I tested correlations between measures of Euroscepticism in the member states and net receipts of EU spending. I also tested how the budgetary relationship of states to the EU changed when a Eurosceptic party entered or left government. The qualitative analyses were based on case studies of four countries which had experience of Eurosceptic parties in government: Italy, Austria, the UK, and Poland. These countries were the target of a more micro-level analysis, based on in-depth reading of both journalistic and political science literature, on how Eurosceptic rhetoric changed over time in each. The nature of these shifts was instructive in highlighting how political parties used Euroscepticism in domestic electoral competition, as well as in interstate bargaining.  I found that the internal political-budgetary dynamics of the EU were similar to that of the U.S- strength of soft Eurosceptic representation in national parliaments was positively associated with net benefits from the EU budget. Quantitative and qualitative analyses suggested a model of strategic Euroscepticism on both echelons of the two-level game. Parties adopted or emphasized Eurosceptic rhetoric strategically in domestic electoral competition to differentiate themselves from traditionally Europhilic mainstream parties, and did the same at the supranational level in order to maximize leverage in interstate bargaining. Indeed, Soft Eurosceptic parties were in pole position to benefit from strategic Euroscepticism, as their problematization of specific policies gave them leverage in negotiations, but did not isolate themselves diplomatically as did extreme hard Eurosceptic parties.  My thesis, thus sought to demonstrate the utility of a two-level games approach in evaluating Euroscepticism in the context of budgetary politics. It is a model of political and distributional contestation that can potentially be identified as an important feature of federal polities more generally.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f8cb14db54cd7a4497e445fc1494c386"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Fiscal policy</subject><subject source="local">Politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_92b45100f3832dac53738eb214b33186" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Delinquent, Amoral, and Americanized: Social Conceptions of Return Migrants in Mexico</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.059.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rohrer, Eleonore S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a81a1438b003c6942f16d10a2764e8a5">"Return migration," according to the International Organization for Migration, "remains the great unwritten chapter in the history of migration."

The sole eligibility requirement is that applicants hold a high school degree or have a job that requires at least two years of training, and the lottery is only open to natives of countries that have sent fewer than 50,000 migrants to the U.S. in the past five years.  This thesis seeks to contextualize the DV Lottery in the overall scope of U.S. immigration policy and inform the political debate in Congress over the program.  Analysis of data from Princeton University's "New Immigrant Survey" shows that, relative to other legal immigrants, DV migrants are younger, more educated, and more likely to speak English well.  Six to eighteen months after obtaining LPR, however, they are slightly less likely to be employed than other legal immigrants.  That discrepancy between DV migrants' educational backgrounds and likelihood of employment is primarily due to their relative lack of experience in the U.S.  Whereas approximately half of all legal immigrants spend time in the U.S. on non-immigrant visas before obtaining LPR, less than 10% of DV migrants had any experience in the U.S. prior to winning the lottery.  In Congress, the debate over the program has revolved primarily around the assumption that the lottery encourages increased diversity in the U.S. immigration system at the cost of attracting primarily low-skilled immigrants.  The data show, however, that this perceived tradeoff does not actually exist.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c60e780de9d9d69ca26a0bb4299f3e12"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Emigration and immigration</subject><subject source="local">Policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f3211c4f8da248847a0a1c3c48cfb205" level="item"><did><unittitle>Testing the Universality of Community Policing: An Evaluation of Chilean Police Reform</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.062.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Weiss, Steven Aaron</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a53323444cab731060d56f7b776486e5">Community policing, while traditionally limited to Western democratic states, has recently been implemented in a number of developing countries with various political systems and institutional structures. Included in this new wave of community policing is Chile's one uniformed police body, the Carabineros de Chile. However, the Carabineros were far from the ideal institution to implement the model; they were a centralized militaristic body that historically refused to be influenced by civil society. This paper examines the outcome of Chile's community policing experiment through interviews, crime data analysis and qualitative studies. It draws three main conclusions. First, while the community policing programs have created collaborative police-community relationships, in certain low socioeconomic and drug-trafficking areas, hostile police-community relations are the norm. Second, it argues that community policing has failed to increase public security. And third, it concludes that institutional constraints were not an obstacle in implementing the community policing model, supporting the idea that community policing can be implemented in centralized and militaristic police institutions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d077e5c2877ade870fe05e6224af9fb1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Community policing</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4db86a7545491df18e891eb7802bd943" level="item"><did><unittitle>Anti-Americanism in South Korea: South Korean Responses to ROK-U.S. Conflicts In the Process of Finding National Identity</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.063.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kim, YoungWoo</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_de074b430c7cb6632f43dfd22fae5b3e">Despite the fact that South Korea and the United States have shared one of the strongest diplomatic relationships in the world since the 1950s, numerous social and political conflicts between South Korea and the United States have incited various anti-American movements in South Korea. Although most South Koreans acknowledge the importance of the U.S. role in the Korean Peninsula, many of them are swept into the rising wave of anti-Americanism. This trend can be seen as an effort to safeguard South Korean history, culture, and national self-identity. The stationing of U.S. military bases in South Korea, the perceived unfairness of military treaties, and the unilateral approach taken by the U.S. in dealing with North Korean- issues have all touched upon the South Korean mentality that has been self-defensive and particularly sensitive to foreign interference. Having taken root in the South Korean public in response to the 1980 Kwangju Uprising, anti-Americanism has since sprouted and has been manifested through civil society movements from the 1980s to the 2000s and is an ongoing social phenomenon that diversely affects South Korean culture, society, and polity.

Seizing on the rise in nationalistic and xenophobic sentiment in society that ensued from the social distress many Russians were experiencing during Yeltsin_�_s rule, the radical right achieved a breakthrough in the 1993 parliamentary elections. Vladimir Zhirinovsky_�_s Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) won 22.9% of the vote, and remained a formidable presence in Russian politics throughout the rest of the decade. 
\
The arrival of Vladimir Putin to the Russian presidency has fundamentally changed the nature of the radical right movement in Russia today. Putin_�_s policies have co-opted many tenets of radical right ideology, and his anti-democratic reforms have suppressed his political competition, as even the LDPR now votes in line with the majority rule. These developments have worked to shift the relevance of the movement from the political sphere to the extra-parliamentary arena. In turn, Putin_�_s policies throughout the 2000s have inadvertently influenced a marked rise in the visibility of radical right groups. Since the middle of the 2000s, radical right groups have: staged increasingly impressive demonstrations; organized successful pogroms; employed more everyday violence on city streets; and have more openly opposed the Putin administration. 
\
The radical right movement in Russia today has developed into a significant phenomenon that deserves further examination, particularly as the political climate in the country has become notably unstable in the past few months.

Many scholars have suggested reasons for this, including the presence of oil, imperial legacies, and security concerns.  My research is an attempt to understand the role education might play in transitioning to and maintaining democracy in the region.  Various scholars have found links between education and democracy worldwide, associating high literacy rates, high cognition, and equal access with higher rates of democracy. I conducted case studies of five countries in the region: Turkey, Lebanon, Tunisia, Egypt and Syria.  I examined their varying levels of democracy, as well as data on access to education, quality and cognition, and freedom of expression.  I also examined the countries_�_ respective constitutions and statements made by their ministries of education.   I have focused especially on Tunisia, where I conducted research with Tufts New Initiative for Middle East Peace.
\
There was not a great deal of variation among the case study countries in the basic indicators of education.  They did vary in terms of their levels of democracy, however.

Factors such as nationalist civic education, teaching style, and conceptions of citizenship appeared to play a part in the relationship between democracy and education.  While the quantitative data do not show conclusively that more educated countries in the MENA region are more democratic, the quality and content of education can tell us a fair amount about this complex relationship.

There is often disregard for the fact that women don_�_t all want the same things. The Middle Eastern Muslim world is a different cultural sphere, and women there have different cultural norms, religious texts, laws, desires and challenges to address when they think about what their rights should be.
\
	This thesis addresses three fundamental questions: what do Middle Eastern Muslim women want?; is the Western notion of women_�_s rights applicable in a Muslim context?; and what role should gender rights play as a foreign policy goal for the United States? I analyze theological scholarship by four prominent feminist authors, who argue that Islam as a religion is not the deciding factor in the perpetuation of gender inequality in the Muslim world. I also conduct case studies of Egyptian and Turkish women_�_s movements as well as Egyptian and Turkish reactions to the 1979 U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Egypt and Turkey both ratified with reservations to Article 16, which concerns marriage, and Turkey has made more progress since ratification toward meeting CEDAW standards. I also analyzed Turkey_�_s progress in regards to European Union gender rights law, and found that while some progress has been made, these requirements have had a mixed impact on Turkish women.
\
	I then perform an in-depth analysis of the evolution of gender rights in U.S. foreign policy, and determine that women_�_s rights are already an important part of U.S. policy in the Middle East, and that if we are to support the emergence of true democracy there, especially in post-Arab spring countries, we must continue our emphasis on women_�_s rights in the future.

Different paths emerged as some countries concentrated on the road back to Europe and others on the return to the Russian realm of control. Foreign policies largely influenced a country_�_s energy dependency situation and varying international goals affected the ability to effectively handle new freedom. This thesis focuses on the cases of Estonia and Ukraine, and their varying energy management systems. Estonia is completely dependent on Russian gas supplies due to lack of reserves, yet it has been able to conduct a successful energy relationship with no conflicts and infrequent price battles. Ukraine, a country with large gas reserves that is less dependent on Russian imports, has led a failed energy relationship with Russia that has included multiple cut-offs and constant price negotiations. Why does a country that is less dependent on Russian gas lead such a tumultuous relationship full of conflict?
\
	This thesis concludes that three specific variables work together to result in either successful or failed energy management: ownership structures, oligarchic powers, and national identity. Research into these economic and political factors has given us an insight into the foundations for poor energy management. With application to other energy dependent countries, these results can provide a new way to analyze gas conflicts and search for solutions.

Some political scientists have observed that policymakers often rely on these same historical analogies to diagnose and analyze foreign policy situations, and draw inferences and policy prescriptions. To what extent have these presumptive _��lessons of the past_�� informed the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of nation building campaigns? I turn to a case study of the Alliance for Progress to investigate the role of analogical reasoning in the decision making process. The Alliance, John F. Kennedy_�_s development program in Latin America, was in many ways a prototype of the _��hearts and minds_�� approach to counterinsurgency. Drawing largely on archival sources, I trace the use of the Marshall Plan analogy in the administration_�_s decision making. I find that reasoning by historical analogy was not determinative of policy outcomes. Rather, domestic politics in both the U.S. and host countries placed the biggest constraints on the Alliance, whose outcomes were underwhelming and at times perverse. However, reasoning by historical analogy may have affected decision making at the margins, particularly by shaping policymakers_�_ prognoses of the program. Analogies contemporaneous to the Marshall Plan_��the reconstruction of Germany and Japan_��were ubiquitous in the occupation of Iraq. As archival materials from the Bush administration are opened to researchers, this may provide a useful case to confirm or refine the arguments made here regarding the impacts of analogical reasoning on policy. I conclude with a discussion of methods and prospects for the more prudential use of history in foreign policy decision making.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7b9d0a4f3a52f5f1c4eac1de12a0701f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_de1d7028db2edca81a8f24e2639ac23d" level="item"><did><unittitle>From Anti-Gay Politics to Frustration: The Formative Relationship between the Polish Right and Gay Rights Activists</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.070.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Walczyszyn, Christopher M. </persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d3137422dff5439d6e233fcb86a0d476">Between 2005 and 2007 the Polish government was controlled by a right-wing coalition of three political parties Law &amp; Justice, Self-Defense, and the League of Polish families. This coalition campaigned on and attempted to realize a vision of social conservatism focused largely on _��otherizing_�� homosexuals. Polish society, which had only been exposed to homosexuality a few years earlier, was bombarded with anti-gay political rhetoric. Constant attacks on _��homosexual propaganda_�� from the education ministry, violations of democratic norms by the government, and expressions of concern from the European Union dominated the national political discourse and came to define the ruling coalition both domestically and abroad.  However, the European Union did little to challenge the government_�_s attacks on Poland_�_s LGBT minority. This forced activists in Poland_�_s fledgling gay rights movement to shift their strategies and alter their approach to combating homophobia from one based primarily on increasing visibility to one based on directly combating the attacks of the ruling elite and challenging their legality. After the ruling coalition was ousted and the governmentally sanctioned homophobic rhetoric subsided, activists were once again forced to restructure their approach to improving the sociopolitical position of homosexuals. Based on a series of interviews, a set of case studies, and reports detailing the Campaign Against Homophobia_�_s actions, I will examine the effects and the legacies of politicized homophobia on gay activism in Poland.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_efa3bc96ee153d95acd9c63a22bcc13b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_67aebdbd1368e23422657ee18e2ed071" level="item"><did><unittitle>Educational Possibilities in Dar es Salaam: A Documentary</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.071.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fisk, Allison M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7140893e5a9ca7ee7da6b63b8e2c837b">This is the written component of my senior thesis for International Relations at Tufts University. My thesis is a documentary about primary school education in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. I filmed this documentary over the course of four months, during which I shot about 180 hours of footage. I filmed at three very different schools in Dar es Salaam - an under-resourced public school on the outskirts of the city, an English-medium private Catholic school, and a relatively well-resourced urban public school. By filming these schools, I am creating a sense of space for the audience to be able to experience these schools, identify with the students and teachers, and understand what their lives are like intellectually and emotionally. In this paper, I explain my goals and reasons for making this documentary, my methodology, some of the challenges I faced, and what I want this film to become.

It is important to note that the gap does not just exist on the constituent level, as gender differences may continue to influence leaders once they take power. Existing global research on women's involvement in politics shows a connection between increased female representation in legislative bodies and more political attention geared toward social issues, such as education and healthcare. While this has been demonstrated in a variety of contexts of lower-levels governments, there is a serious lack of scholarship on the effects of having a woman in a position of national leadership. This study investigates changes or consistencies in a country's developmental health policies when a woman holds the position of prime minister for the first time. A case study approach, using India under Indira Gandhi, Pakistan under Benazir Bhutto, and Bangladesh under Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, will track health policies implemented by a woman prime minister of a low-income country. Maternal and child health policies are used as indicators for this paper, on the basis of addressing issues both gendered and universal in scope. Ultimately, there is evidence to support more national attention toward maternal and child health under a woman prime minister, which has many crucial implications for future policies and analysis.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_29e1cd835e585ab1c380bf1282d5144e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in International Relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_080f14894985543577805e6cd9634c7e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Atlanticism and Europeanism: Spanish Public Opinion on Security Policy in Comparative Perspective</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.074.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wasson, Megan M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ef9ab3a1ec325f91ff64f16b62e1538a">This paper analyzes public opinion in Spain on NATO and on the European Union's Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) and Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).  Spanish public opinion is analyzed within the context of Spanish interests and by comparison with public opinion in the other EU member states of France, Italy, Germany, the UK, and Poland.  The public opinion analysis is based on the German Marshall Fund's Transatlantic Trends survey questions from the 2000s, often supplemented with analysis of other survey questions from earlier decades.  I also make use of two multivariate regression models to determine influences on support for European-centric and Atlantically-oriented security policy preferences. Spain is a strong EU member, and as Spain is a democracy that must be mindful of citizens' opinions, public opinion in Spain will likely having bearing on future EU policy.  In the 2000s, the Iraq War severely damaged Spanish opinion on both the US and NATO, and EU security policy became a concrete reality, setting the stage for greater support of EU security measures.  However, I find that the majority of Spaniards still favor a strong EU-US security relationship.  A significant portion of Spaniards, and Europeans, also support both the CFSP and CSDP.  It seems that Spaniards want the EU to be a strong world leader, but within the context of the EU-US security relationship.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_50dbaaecbff2da9c2953ca0ccee7410b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in International Relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ed60f4f785741bea3e18bedd0ab5cae1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Ideology and Grand Strategy in the Arab-Israeli Conflict: Syria and Israel, 1963-1973</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.075.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Yarnell, Brent E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_80685ec6fc2f082e62b53acad9112bdc">According to neorealism, states are rational actors whose overriding objective is survival, and who formulate their foreign policies based on calculations of the balance of power. The history of Syrian and Israeli foreign policy, however, demonstrates that ideology often plays an important role in identifying the political objectives states pursue on the international arena as well as the grand strategies they employ. This paper explores Syrian and Israeli foreign policy during the period 1963-1973. This period included the June 1967 Six Day War and the October 1973 War, as well as numerous other violent clashes. The period also saw significant ideological flux in the leaderships of both countries. In Syria, the Ba'ath regime that seized power in 1963 was guided by the vision of Pan-Arabism. The Neo-Ba'ath regime that ruled from 1967-1970 was guided by a leftist revolutionary creed. Hafiz al-Assad, who took power in 1970, was a non-ideological realist. In Israel, the Old Guard Mapai leadership that had governed Israel since the period of the British Mandate gradually gave way to other factions, bringing the radical Ahdut Ha'Avodah party into the governing coalition in 1965, and forming a National Unity Government on the eve of war in 1967 that brought Menachem Begin's right wing Cherut party into the Cabinet. In both countries, the ideologies of competing leadership groups exerted a strong influence on the different grand strategies they developed to meet the international threats and opportunities their countries faced. This paper traces the way that changes in the ideological orientation of the leadership in Syria and Israel during this period influenced the grand strategies those states employed, and traces the effect those grand strategies had in on the Arab-Israeli conflict.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_504053d4eba5c9e341b7338bcc7b3bcc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in International Relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4204e04308424624a68e4be56b75535b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Water Words: Discourses of Development in Israel and the Palestinian Territories</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.076.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rafferty, Mark P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8defc2bf06e6b41a332af1efee7b5ff0">Israel and the Palestinian Territories sit at a troubled intersection of political unrest and environmental insecurity. In both Israel and Palestine, water flows through a complex network of physical and social structures, meaning that contestation of this water is multifaceted and complex. Today, struggles over water in the region revolve around efforts to determine how water resources should be distributed and managed. However, given the complexity of water networks and their lack of objective boundaries, even having conversations about what water is to be managed can be a contentious process. Planners and policymakers must determine which aspects of water networks need their attention, and they must make decisions as to the scale and level at which these problems should be approached. This thesis examines the development of the field of water studies in the Israeli-Palestinian context, and it shows how competing actors and institutions seek to influence development policies by presenting and legitimizing different frameworks for understanding the region's water. Some actors in the field argue that water in the region should be viewed as a material resource to be distributed in a way that provides the maximum utility to the maximum number of users. For others, water is a resource endowed with cultural and social meaning that should be distributed according to normative understandings of rights and ownership.  For other actors, there are yet other standards to determine how water should be perceived and dealt with. Actors within the water field frequently communicate with each other to contest paradigms of Israeli and Palestinian water problems and to promote new frameworks to inform political and physical development of water networks in the basin. These conversationsand their philosophical and sociopolitical underpinningsare the focus of this thesis. The thesis examines discourses propagated by Israeli, Palestinian, and international actors. While breaking down problematic assumptions usually attached to these actors and their positions, this thesis looks closely at the strategies that these actors use to position themselves vis--vis other actors and discourses within the field. Ultimately, it aims to shed light on the state of the interdisciplinary water management field in Israel and the Palestinian Territories and to lay the groundwork for discussions about how the field's component disciplines might communicate more effectively to form a more coherent, more effective whole.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2089996ab34fdcfc05cc6f0c81bea9bc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in International Relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_522ea6b8bd7faaaa20165a1a57a418d5" level="item"><did><unittitle>China's Pursuit of Energy Security: Implications for U.S.-China Relations</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.077.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hosios, Ilana F.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c498a8d0c115bcc55754b661c88151c6">This thesis examines whether China's pursuit of energy security is based solely on growing demand and the most economic solutions to meet that demand or if it is intended to weaken American power projection in highly strategic areas. The main argument is that China's economic interests are the driving force behind its pursuit of energy security. While China has acted increasingly aggressive towards the U.S. or U.S. interests in the context of energy security, it will only do so to a point due to the detrimental economic impact of a Sino-American conflict. China has three core interests: to maintain China's fundamental system and state security, to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to continue the stable development of the economy and society. China's national security strategy is intended to protect these interests. This thesis examines how China's pursuit of energy security relates to China's national security strategy. It analyzes three components of China's pursuit of energy security: China's energy sector, China's maritime strategy and the China's alliances in the Middle East. In the first chapter, the analysis of China's energy sector reveals that the government agencies involved with energy security lack the funding and manpower to be able to develop and implement a national strategy. Additionally, there is a significant disconnect between China's national oil companies and the central government. The companies pursue their corporate interests without considering foreign policy implications. The second chapter focuses on China's naval strategy with respect to energy security. It examines the China's rapid naval modernization and aggressive activity in sea-lanes of communication and the South and East China Seas. With respect to energy security and national security it is advantageous for China's naval strategy to be aggressive while ensuring that it does not lead to a conflict with the U.S. The final chapter examines China's pursuit of energy security in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia and Iran. With respect to both countries, China is primarily interested in oil. At times, China has taken advantage of its relations in the Middle East to diminish U.S. influence in the region. Nonetheless, when the well being of China's economy is at stake, it is more interested in cooperating rather than challenging the U.S.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4f46080add5717f9585becfcf0d117b7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in International Relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fe0158166b4f053b4486a8b13d4fdf04" level="item"><did><unittitle>Female Suffrage and Gender Politics in France</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.078.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ades, Anika R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ca0810cfd5dfdc63e97a54ad3b084243">In the industrialized world, states with large Catholic populations have enfranchised women on average 20-30 years later than states that are predominantly Protestant. The prevailing explanation for this phenomenon is largely cultural; Catholic doctrine creates strictly traditional roles for women and creates a culture of female oppression. This paper will show that in the French example, the delay in suffrage was actually caused by the parties of the Left who
                                feared that the mass influx of highly religious and very conservative female voters would upset the fragile framework of the French government and would increase the political power of conservative parties. Conversely, the Catholic Church and Catholic Parties were the strongest supporters of the female vote because women tended to align themselves with the policies and parties of the Church. This resulted in a paradox in which the Catholic Church was the strongest
                                supporter of female suffrage, and the ideologically progressive Leftist parties worked to suppress the female vote. Following female enfranchisement in 1944 under Charles de Gaulle, women were indeed more conservative and more religious voters than men. From the 1960s through the present, however, women have become dramatically less religious, and have accordingly shifted in ideology from the Right to the Left. This ideological shift coincides with increased
                                female participation in the workforce and union membership, secularization and modernization of French society and economy, but ultimately is rooted in increased access to higher education amongst women in France.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0b2ecf38cd600a89555f1a14d9c721a8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Specifically, it focuses on the stability of Afghanistan and the diversification of Central Asian energy economies via Iranian participation in Caspian energy projects. At the height of Soviet prominence, the Soviets monopolized Central Asian energy economies by constructing pipelines that were reliant on Russian transit routes to Europe.
                                After the collapse of the Soviet Union, American policy in the region failed to promote the independence of Central Asia and Azerbaijan by hindering the diversification of Central Asian and Azerbaijani energy economies. Instead, the United States pursued a policy to prioritize the economic and political development of Russia while simultaneously containing Iran. By barring Iranian participation in Caspian Energy projects, America prevents competition and empowers
                                Russian influence in Central Asia. The essay discusses the competing interests of all the major powers in Central Asia (China, Russia, India, Turkey, Iran, America) before exploring how American-Iranian interests converge and diverge in the region. Next, the essay explains how Iranian participation in Caspian energy projects will counter Russian imperialism and mitigate China's rise in the region, thus benefiting American interests. Despite mutual interests, the
                                argument acknowledges and rectifies potentially divergent interests in the Persian Gulf and Central Asia. Next, the thesis identifies the obstacles to a feasible American policy in the region, namely the Saudi and Israeli lobbies. In conclusion, the thesis provides a prescription for a new American policy in the region and discusses the implications of this new approach.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3223285196acf11bd7138ae95911b735"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><geogname source="local">United States -- Foreign relations -- Iran.</geogname><geogname source="local">Iran -- Foreign relations -- United States.</geogname><geogname source="local">Asia, Central -- Politics and government.</geogname><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University International Relations Program.</subject><subject source="local">Post-communism -- Asia, Central.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c082189d5741be04c58a808628ce734a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Analysis of Food Preferences for Policy: A Case Study of the Latino Community in Somerville</unittitle><unitid>UA005.004.080.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Caplan, Emily B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ba3f70ca84f416b7f58613329dd18a60">Obesity is a rising health concern in the United States, and availability of healthy foods in grocery stores is an important factor. Lacking from the current literature in this area is a culturally specific analysis of what drives food preferences and a consideration of culture in the development of healthy food policies. This study examines the motivations behind food preferences in a specific Latino community in East Somerville. Based on study findings, the

Using a quantitative Nutrition Environment Measures Survey for stores (NEMS-S) that I worked on last summer in Guatemala to determine the availability of healthy food options in three Latino bodegas, and qualitative interviews to determine what drives consumer food preferences, I tested three hypotheses: 1. The foods found in the three
                                Latino bodegas will apply more closely to the NEMS-S survey created in Guatemala than the general NEMS-S survey created for U.S. stores, meaning that consumer buying preferences in these stores are molded more by culture of origin than by culture of residence, 2.

In the last few years, Jobbik in Hungary and Golden Dawn in Greece have gone from fringe extremists with no electoral power to parties with seats in national and European parliaments. Though the rise of the radical right as a Europe-wide phenomenon was unexpected, the successes
                                of Jobbik and Golden Dawn are especially surprising because these parties are much more extreme than other successful far right groups. Golden Dawn is anti-immigrant, Jobbik is anti- Roma, and both parties are anti-Semitic. They explicitly use symbols, language, and tactics that evoke the fascists of the 1930s and 1940s. These parties are growing and their success directly contradicts previous scholarship on the radical right. In this thesis I address the
                                anomalous successes of Jobbik and Golden Dawn and present a new party family type called nationalist extremists. In addition to creating this party group, I formulate a theoretical framework to explain the factors that make nationalist extremist success a possibility. Finally, I present comprehensive reviews of Jobbik and Golden Dawn's histories, ideologies, and activities in order to demonstrate their unique spots in the far right party pantheon.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e259d5de3bc872f2244287bd678bb0c0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The questions addressed in this thesis are: 1. How do late delivery penalties implemented by the buyer affect the stress level of the supervisor in the sourcing factories? 2. How does the stress level of the supervisor influence the amount of verbal abuse the workers in the factory are subjected to? 3. How does this use of verbal abuse, affected by the delivery penalty, affect both wages and productivity? The purpose of answering these questions is to analyze the proposed business case for delivery penalties. Through the creation of a theoretical model and regression analyses, the results disprove the possibility of a business case.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

With images of violence and human suffering, this process translates facts and figures into a language of images that all who see the photograph can speak, understand, and engage. While this method of information consumption is by no mean encompassing, the limit of the frame does enable the photographer to make mass atrocity available for mass consumption. An atrocity photograph, therefore, is both universal and restrictive as a method of communication: though it can convey a photographer's intentions to a viewer, it cannot present a comprehensive understanding of violent acts or the complete context of human suffering. Ariella Azoulay addresses the potential of universal connections via atrocity portraiture with the Civil Contract of Photography, or the ideas of citizenry in the photographic processes and how this creates a contract of trust among
                the three relational actors of a photograph: the subject, the photographer, and the spectator. This thesis analyzes three c axes of atrocity portraiture within the structure of the Civil Contract of Photography, examining the ways in which different genres of atrocity portraits with unique methods of image construction and exhibition contribute to global imaginaries of mass atrocities and deeper engagement of viewer response outside of the photographic frame.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Through that research, I reach three ultimate conclusions. First, the collective growth of the Israeli populace (particularly within Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish factions) will create significant economic challenges for the state and will disrupt existing social dynamics. Thus, once demographic phenomena manifest, in the next twenty to thirty years, a negotiated peace will be infeasible. Second, the current governmental contexts within Israel (in the wake of new parliamentary elections) and Palestine (following the unification of Hamas and Fatah) make peace a theoretical possibility, but one that would require tremendous political sacrifice. Finally, given this insight, on a practical level, I argue that no current peace proposals are logistically viable, and that Israel and Palestine will likely evolve into a de facto singular state in the
                next several decades.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Israel--Politics and government-- 21st century.</geogname><geogname source="local">Israel--Population--Statistics.</geogname><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The current composition of the G20 has led to great discourse on the organization's lack of representation. This thesis attempts to understand the nature of representation in the G20. Using a probability regression technique, an admission criterion is constructed to illustrate the conditions that led to its existing composition. This is applied to a list of invited countries that have been invited to the G20 Summits, understanding if and how they fit in with the criteria. Singapore, a small city-state in Southeast Asia, which has since been invited 5 times to G20 Summits, is used as a case study to analyze how it differentiates itself from other countries to increase its G20 involvement. My thesis speaks for greater voice from non-members and smaller states that might be excluded from the G20

By finding the relationship between these two levels, we can reveal the underlying causes of violence against women, both at home and away at war.

This belief that multiculturalism had created divided populations across European had also been debated fiercely in the academic literature on immigration and immigrant integration since the turn of the century. Yet this is not the only debate about integration taking place in the literature. Many scholars debate whether European integration processes due to supranational norms and institutions, such as the EU. Yet, these qualitative debates about integration policy appear to be taking place in a vacuum. In the academic literature, there is little discussion of ways to measure the efficacy integration policies in a quantitative fashion. Amongst EU policy-makers, this idea has been on the table for almost fifteen with only a few reports to show for it.
                Thus, my research seeks to add to the body of research on European immigrant integration, by examining what makes an integration policy more or less effective. To do this, I have examined the issue from both angles: quantitative and qualitative. On the quantitative side, I created a scale to measure integration policies of 25 EU countries against each other, using EU definitions of integration and Eurostat, Eurobarometer, OECD, and MIPEX data. Furthermore, I seek to examine immigration integration in greater depth by examining three different cases, Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. Thus, by examining it from multiple angles, I aim to better understand this important issue.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

There have beenseven different prime ministers in five years and none have completed a full term. The liberalconservative LDP and socially liberal DPJ have proposed and produced contradicting reforms.Following the devastating Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami on March 11, 2011, Japanexperienced a sudden growth in the visibility of its political artists. The work created in responseto the natural disaster was illustrated as advocacy, therapy, and creative expression, showcasinghow in many ways disasters are a paradox. Large-scale disasters breed renewal despite the chaosand destruction, while simultaneously bonding the victims through their need for reflection andsurvival. The limited government responses to support or encourage relief efforts contribute to apolitical discourse. I will look at how the history of

Interestingly, the few studies that have explicitly explored gender differences in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been at odds with this conventional wisdom. Most investigations of public opinion in Israel and Palestine have found little to no variation between male and female attitudes.I hypothesize that this discrepancy may arise because such studies of gender differences in Israel and Palestine have often neglected to analyze survey questions that ask respondents about theoretically gendered topics. I additionally posit that the heightened security threats faced by Israelis and Palestinians in their everyday lives may temper the gender gaps observed in other international contexts. Using
                a wide variety of survey data from 1988 to present, I test these hypotheses by analyzing gender differences in Israeli and Palestinian attitudes towards threat perception, the peace process, violence, and defense spending.The gender gaps that emerge in my findings are at odds with the conclusions drawn in past studies and demonstrate the important role that the gendered nature of threat perception plays in shaping Israeli and Palestinian attitudes towards the use of force. These findings have important theoretical implications for the study of gender and politics as well as key ramifications for the future of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

pages like tasty leaves in my big corner chair. My husband would chase me around, trying to get me to put them down, but his bright eyes were no match for those beautiful bindings, his small remarks no substitute for those tall tales in neat lines.

The narrator, Jamie, has just experienced two traumatic events: her father died from a sudden heart attack, and her mother, who was seven months pregnant at the time, gave birth to a stillborn. The novella begins in the aftermath, as Jamie suffers in the care of her depressed mother and avoids addressing or understanding her own feelings. Due to Jamie's resistance to a dictionary homework assignment, her guidance counselor assigns a project of writing her own dictionary in the hopes that it will help her explore her grief. The majority of the novella is structured as Jamie's dictionary: a heading of a particular word and how she defines it in the realm of her experience. Ultimately, Jamie will struggle to define the concepts of 'stillborn' and 'heart attack' and to address the depth of loss.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f350293145cca5be22a61c5971969a67"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of English</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d92ceb91b9e97f358a1d3cf97ab1a1cc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Tattered Cloth</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.060.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Title, Cathryn</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0004f498a22b681e96ae67b0baf4ad38">Creative Writing Thesis-Novella.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_242567213d4588837d4fb3fc241f9f62"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of English</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4fdf428969bf56d9d97e6feedc447368" level="item"><did><unittitle>Unhealthy Appetites: Food and Digestion in Early Modern Drama</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.061.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Toohey, Devin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_86383dcf26ac8ad3b7991876636c23d3" label="Books [39090015513472b]" type="box">Volume 61</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_692bd04c1bf6e4b783e745d6de0b0ad2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of English</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_20e5af72837d51798dde10a3d8612f41" level="item"><did><unittitle>Joseph Mitchell's Burden</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.062.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Webber, Chase Jeffrey</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_3372bf1c9654c3a792277ae19985f8b6" label="Books [39090015513530b]" type="box">Volume 62</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fe7955e2e5383cf7447a88e8ac45deee"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of English</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_de7d70232267b60b3b0f0384c6316af8" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Meadows</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.063.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Aichenbaum, David B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_470a5b606e5fb9f70f1513a7d8525478">The inhabitants of the small town, Trial, search for the turkeys, people, and selves  they have lost or misplaced.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c16d1d01d7e82645619ab831a4480bfc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of English</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2aa34bf11ec71916602ea116dafa8497" level="item"><did><unittitle>different all the way through, every time: An Analysis of Post-WWII Experimental Fiction</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.064.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Berger, Ned C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1e971a993f9ee5d595155c8aad699252">An analysis of Post WWII experimental modes of fiction.

The death of newspapers. The outlook, as they say, is grim. But social media, rather than heralded as the destructeur of journalism and journalistic integrity, has finally begun to play a substantial role in the daily activities of journalists. This is not only as an effective method of content promotion or a tool to drive traffic to traditional websites, but as a real, relevant or even necessary tool in a journalist's arsenal that has improved her ability to gather information, conduct research, and examine the context of her findings. So how have the Internet and the prevalence of social media among Internet users forced reporters, editors, and news organizations to adapt the ways in which they work, in both news gathering and content creation?  This thesis examines the strategies employed by reporters, editors, and other news professionals to implement social media as an integral part of their workflow. It will explore journalists' habits and instincts in using the Internet as a resource, and their perceptions of the effectiveness of these tools. Ultimately, the research conducted throughout this study concludes that these tools are instrumental in maintaining the relevance of traditional media, recognizes the importance of integrating new methods with the skilled craft of journalism, and anticipates increased and increasingly successful implementation of social media into the cadre of news organizations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ee0850b7b2ce14ebe8d6e83bac55eda9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of English</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6925b414723d9913028617e14595ce0d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Sleepy Men Staring at the Sky</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.066.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Taylor, Benjamin D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_aaa139b3b8b835171f2c1189eaa14ad8">A collection of six short stories.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1119072ac45fc27f804008ce569e0d6b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Short stories</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1e42f1b65ba8560193c30bdfa6d07f2e" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Knowledge of Her Own: Unlocking the Forbidden Room in Villette</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.067.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Beehler, Brianna Antoinette</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_69ec9eebc215d4f36ca4f55b7274eee6">Lucy Snowe, the narrator of Charlotte Brontë's final novel Villette (1853), suffers from two distinct nervous disorders: hysteria and paranoia.  Past criticism has argued that hysteria is productive in Villette, but I argue that through hysteria Lucy has only limited access to knowledge, and that by transitioning into a paranoid state Lucy commences an active investigation.  Consequently, Lucy's process of accessing knowledge evolves over the course of the novel.  While she is able to feel knowledge inside her from early on, she admits that she does not actually know it.  This limitation results from the different functions of her two disorders – that is, that hysteria contains knowledge and that paranoia attains knowledge.  Lucy's disorders do not work concurrently – where hysteria encounters its limits and leaves off, paranoia takes over.  Lucy's paranoia becomes effective in that her sense of knowing induces her to pursue a confirmation of knowledge that is ultimately correct or revealing.  In the process, Lucy unearths both knowledge and unknowledge.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d4ea2252acb6a73b46f8f068c502daa7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">English literature</subject><subject source="local">History and criticism</subject><persname source="local">Bronte, Charlotte, 1816-1855</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fd6003659b62b5c01063ea2135df9801" level="item"><did><unittitle>Virginia Woolf's Critique of Philosophy and Development of Aesthetic Prose</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.068.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bushnell, Emma Lia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c9e8949f398fcb3c15c8a8e123df40d7">In this thesis I first examine Virginia Woolf's rejection of philosophy that begins in "Mrs. Dalloway" and matures in "To the Lighthouse."

Jacques Derrida's reading of the Babel myth in relation to the act of translation challenges the latent assumptions that these pioneers make in using the myth of Babel, and thus challenges the motivations behind creating artificial languages. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first part consists of a review of the figure of Babel, briefly sketching out the history of Babel in its classical roots, before examining in greater depth the issues laid out by George Steiner's After Babel. The second part extends on the historic debate, consisting of a review of Babel in Derrida's critiques. The third part examines historical efforts to break out of the perceived curse of Babel, in the form of the artificial language movement and of I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden's Basic International English. The metaphor of translation, and consequently Babel which represents the necessity of translation, is ever part of the movement for globalization. However, this metaphor is made problematic through the analysis of these trends through the lens of Derridian criticism.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1d034fb5a1c2a1a0d51670a0c247db77"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Bible</subject><subject source="local">History and criticism</subject><subject source="local">Babel, Tower of</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_35935842113a7874f3db429ba978a677" level="item"><did><unittitle>Fiction After September 11 and the Destabilization of Mass Narratives</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.070.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Elmets, Michael W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4d46d8df9930b56e29efbd5fd5173603">September 11, 2001 can be, and, perhaps, more often than not is, regarded as a turning point in the history of the United States – its politics, its version of diplomacy, its understanding of terrorism, violence, and catastrophe, its popular culture, its literature.  While novelists have been slow to respond to the events of September 11, works of fiction have begun to be produced.  Codification of the ways in which September 11 has been contextualized has tended to constrict understanding of the attacks to monolithic mass narratives that defy individual experience.  In my thesis, I analyze the ways in which these narratives have been constructed and also the ways in which novelists have struggled against them in works of fiction.  As such, the primary works explored in this thesis are Don DeLillo's "Falling Man" and Philip Roth's "Exit Ghost."  Through the analysis of these texts and the rejection of monolithic mass narrative, a richer and more complex understanding of September 11 can arise.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a711dfdd7395276d84b1092c67714b90"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">American literature</subject><subject source="local">History and criticism</subject><subject source="local">September 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7b81229907b23c1fc8af780765c71dfe" level="item"><did><unittitle>Vindicta Nostris: The Psychological Development of Seneca's Revenger in the Elizabethan Renaissance</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.071.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wetherill, Robin H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_79e04b661e6ca73c45f47e037632f30c">I reveal the psychological mind of the Renaissance revenger, a mind that would not have been possible without the characters of Seneca.

While considering Seneca's own views on literary imitation, I attempt to unearth the traces of Senecan influence which allow Kyd and then Shakespeare to construct a form of revenge that further develops the model begun by Seneca.  The classical dramatist presents us with characters who have already been destabilized and whose potential for evil has already been established.

The gutter in comics makes clear that narrative can continue (in the form of reproductive futurity) only inasmuch as we continue to suture together gaps in narrative (the gaps of queer jouissance) through the _��imperative of figuration_�� and the compulsion to create meaning. The gutter and repetition stand in relation to deconstructionist ideas about the slippage inherent in meaning, but also have implications for our understanding of Lacanian orders (see: David Ault_�_s work on comics and Lacan).
\
The comics medium, with its unique spatial/temporal relation, provides a visual metaphor for time, and in doing so offer ways for readers to envision time and space differently; because queerness is placed in opposition to institutions of linear time (family, heterosexual futurism, reproduction, capitalism), it challenges the idea of _��reproductive temporality,_�� (Halberstam, 4) and instead posits new temporalities _�_ ones that refuse forward movement through the institutions of generational inheritance and instead fuck with the family tree. Queer/comix temporalities fold back, repeat, stutter, and offer new ways of relating to time that are not driven by a reproductive imperative. In the literal illustration of the gutter/closure, the meaning/nonmeaning relation through the mechanisms of panel, gutter, and frame, comics make visible the queer element in all artistic media, and thus make visible the instability of any symbolic investment.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4e5e311db8e87d7ebaec5820a85fa817"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_a2094ca83ecf2e107dd1471ad927ca24" level="item"><did><unittitle>We Did Not Ask To Be Colonized: Legacies of Colonial Trauma in 21st Century African Fiction</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.076.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cox, Emily</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ca8875c01fd5fbda628390e5bfbd5bf4">The past two centuries have left a lasting mark on the continent of Africa.  From the Horn to the Cape, the eras of conquest, colonialism, and post-colonialism were violent and unsettling for the millions of people who called the Continent home.  The traumatic events in Africans_�_ lives are as unique as the Continent is vast, yet the universal circumstances of colonialism create similarities that span circumstance and geography.  Speak Rwanda by Julian R Pierce deals with the cataclysmic trauma of genocide, while Knots by Nuruddin Farah highlights the more insidious traumas of urban civil war.  Purple Hibiscus by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichi, deals with the traumatic fallout from domestic abuse, a unique situation where the line between cataclysmic and insidious blurs.   The stories and experiences of the characters may vary, but through all the narratives runs a thread that connects not only Africans but all oppressed, victimized, or colonized people.  All three look to colonial legacies for explanations of the events in the more immediate past.  These narratives not only struggle with the question of blame, but also with the question of what is to come in the future.  All three novels indicate that healing, both from the distant and recent past, has begun, but the novels also acknowledge that the shadow of the colonial past still looms large in the 21st century</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9d4850367a9de4ebc187ef15dc95ffee"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_d6b791f123ecf3ea6c753283a3bec28e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Augury: Love Stories</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.077.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Schwartz, David Lerner</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ca7f05957a269ac5b15f8f1c672b4136">Seven short stories inspired by seven different parts of the Bible combined in a book that questions where we should put our love to be less anxious about our future in a postlapsarian, fallen society.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_feda09c2d9391cc2359e77aea411bb0c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of English</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4c311af63fd234b08d6dc8ba89667952" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Poetics of the Queered Elegy: Frank O'Hara's "In Memory of My Feelings"</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.078.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sax, Adam Marcus</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_29ae7758135877383b26d89b51ad8e80">Frank O'Hara's poem In Memory of My Feelings does not behave like an elegy; yet this essay will seek to affirm that, as its title would suggest, this poem comes out of a tradition that memorializes that which is lost and seeks to affirm that which remains behind. Through the examination of the poetic structures of this queered form of the elegy, an elegy that stands outside the tradition and normative constructions of the elegy, we find a poetic form that mourns feelings, instead of a tangible, physically losable love-object. We will find how these structures, not uncommon to other O'Hara poems and examined in depth from poems such as For Grace, After a Party and For James Dean, shift in their significations when introduced to the environment of this queered self-elegy. Via the structural lens of the critic Helen Vendler, aided by the queered vantages of Lee Edelman and Donald E. Hall, and the post-modernist Marjorie Perloff, this paper examines how the two dominant interpretive modes of the elegy, those of Peter Sacks and Jahan Ramazani, fail to examine the intricacies of such an elegy. This paper will show how the understanding of queerness, when applied to poetics, is an the attribute of being one thing, yet existing outside the norms and structures that regulate such a thing, such as a poem. Thus In Memory of My Feelings is a self-elegy that performs outside the norms of the self-elegy. It does not resolve loss, but rather perpetuates it, understands loss as a part of a pattern of irresolvabilities that carry on throughout the structure of the poem.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_82eb3037c76d49aa4e9da9787f0e6740"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of English</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a67197fbb697f9257c3fffedfbd34c7b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Let My People Go: The Hebrew Bible, Freedom and Oppression in Faulkner's As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom! and Go Down, Moses</unittitle><unitid>UA005.005.079.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Greenberg, Lauren</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e9a42dbcfd31dab3c94f41c7aca1bc6c">In this thesis I am exploring points of intersection and allusion to the bible in Faulkner's As I Lay Dying, Absalom, Absalom! and Go Down, Moses, looking specifically at the light that each text can shed on the reading of the other.

This barrier is not meant to be crossed or passed and racial identities can exist on only one side of the line. The fact that the distinction between black and white exists at all presents a larger issue because it eliminates the possibility of the more fluid or mixed racial identities that can exist outside of a binary. For some Americans, however, having African ancestry does not mean that their socially assigned race corresponds to their racial optic. In spite of the color line's attempt to separate Americans into distinct racial categories, centuries of sexual violence and forced interracial unions resulted in a group of optically white Americans with African ancestry. This contradiction between white bodies and legal or social blackness exposes the myth of a racial binary because in order to fully express his or her identity, an optically white and legally black American would need to exist on both sides of the color line simultaneously, an impossible feat given the binary's goal of racial separation. This thesis considers African Americans passing for white in \An Imperative Duty\" (1891) by William Dean Howells \"Iola Leroy or Shadows Uplifted\" (1892) by Frances Harper \"Pudd'nhead Wilson\" (1894) by Mark Twain \"Of One Blood or The Hidden Self\" (1903) by Pauline Hopkins \"Plum Bun\" (1928) by Jessie Fauset and \"Passing\" (1929) by Nella Larsen. Furthermore this thesis examines the distinction between unintentional and intentional passing and specifically discusses how each text uses passing as a means of responding to questioning and fighting back against racism in American society.

Du Bois (1868-1963) published his most influential work The Souls of Black Folk, he stood between the end of the era of Reconstruction and the rise of the era of Jim Crow segregation, the Great Migration, and the New Negro Renaissance. He was at the tail end of the breed of race leadership shaped by the slave narrative genre and the writings of Nat Turner and Frederick Douglass. Despite Du Bois's continued intellectual and editorial influence over black writers, the Harlem Renaissance had challenged his authority. Du Bois argued that black artistic production would prove integral to somehow paving the way for blacks to achieve a politically democratic future and to contribute their shared 'gift' of cultural virtue to America. Key terms like 'Africa,' 'Negro soul,' 'racial genius,' all held deep importance in Du Bois's nationalistic conception of the Negro and his political and cultural program of uplift. However, with the rise of a
                generation of 'New Negroes' - who I am calling the liberal humanist generation - these essentialist terms began to loose their weight as authoritative explanations of the black experience in America. I juxtapose the new language of liberal expressionism against Du Bois's nationalistic tropes to emphasize the importance of a literary analysis of Du Bois's works as well as those of the younger generation; these literary works capture arguably the first liberal shift in the language of talking about blackness in America. The literary expressions of the liberal generation, under my methodology, become interesting as they are situated within this generational history of departure from black cultural nationalism. Therefore, by turning to the literature of these artists, we enrich our understanding of how the liberal humanists used literature to push black cultural nationalism into crisis and in so doing, moved beyond the essentialist narratives of understanding blackness.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Because response only occurs in the future, correspondence is predicated upon and invested in a future that is continuously and indefinitely deferred. To be a correspondent -- to be co-respondent -- is, I argue, to occupy a contingent and queer position: once one has entered into a correspondence, one has entered into a state of indefinite wait, always anticipating a letter that may never come. This thesis seeks to agitate perceptions, readings, and understandings of correspondence by insisting upon its queerness and incoherence. On the one hand, I explore epistolary correspondence as something more (or something other) than a set of pure biographical data or a coherent narrative. On the other, I explore correspondent relationality as theoretical praxis or reading practice -- in applying it to texts not specifically epistolary in form as a way of examining the relation of queerness and
                contingency to text and reading more generally. Engaging two principal theoretical traditions -- queer theory and deconstructionist and post-structuralist literary theory -- I explore in each chapter a different figure for the indefinite non-definition of correspondent and literary relationality: suture (of letters, literature, or identity), 'the fold' (of the letter, of a societal margin, of/as 'queer community'), and the ever-receding line of the horizon.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Pronouns and context modulate the simulation's perspective between the protagonist's internal perspective and an external onlooker's perspective. An experiment investigated if visual or tactile specific context-- the object property statements the tomato is red or the tomato is cold-- modulates the simulation perspective. Ninety-four undergraduates read discourses then verified discourse events in images. Experiment varied the pronoun, property modality, and image perspective.  Modal-specific context did not interact with pronoun and image perspective to modulate simulation perspective as measured in task accuracy, F(2, 154) = 1.638, p = 0.198, but results still support perceptual symbol theory. Participants simulated narratives more richly if narrative was self-relevant.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_78be631251fe9923170c1fc0e1714495"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_70078644f5bfa5b8d275842ee1b34d12" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Undoing Effect of Positive Emotion in Children</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.101.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brethel, Kristin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_14481c69c6489d94685b62a6f119511c">The current study was conducted to determine if positive emotions serve to undo negative emotion, and to test if this effect varies with individual differences in behavior and temperament. Twenty-two children (11 male, ages 8-11) were presented with two blocks of three film clips.  Each began with a low arousal baseline, followed by a sad clip and then either a happy or neutral clip. Contrary to predictions, the undoing effect was not seen in any of the measures. However, children rated high on attention showed less recovery from sadness while those rated high on inhibitory control showed greater recovery. Failure to observe the undoing effect in this sample may mean that this strategy of emotion regulation appears later in development.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3c1b56e681d8b3ef9869b9a4276c2b53"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_483ff0c7a17f6b1b4975bb25b27e2adc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Using Event-Related Potentials to Explore Sentential Code-Switching in English-French Bilinguals</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.102.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Litcofsky, Kaitlyn</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c3b8c734cc482efb68bd046e15ee6ec2">Code-switching is known to incur a processing cost, yet little is known regarding what occurs after the code-switched word.  The current study tested English (L1)-French (L2) unbalanced bilinguals in an Event-Related Potential (ERP) study in which they read sentences and performed a plausibility judgment.  Sentences contained either no code-switches, one code-switch (i.e., switching into the second language), or two code-switches (i.e., switching into the second language and returning to the original language).  A Late Positive Component was evoked to L2 items at the code-switched word and  an N400 was evoked to all code-switched conditions at the sentence-final word.

Whether through coffee, soft drinks, food, or medication, caffeine is ingested habitually by most of the human population.   As a stimulant, caffeine causes wakefulness, sustained intellectual activity, and even mood elevation (Hodgman, 1998), making it a popular additive to daily human food and beverage intake. In addition to benefits, however, caffeine has addicting qualities, and thereby causes deleterious effects once consumers go through withdrawal of the drug.  This study will further investigate the nature of caffeine dependence through analysis of pain perception once a habitual consumer is in caffeine withdrawal.    The analgesic effects of caffeine, although confirmed by numerous studies, are poorly understood.  This study will contribute to the knowledge regarding the conditions under which analgesia is experienced upon caffeine consumption.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_48c69e27905d4547dec481260aa6f77c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e12882fc1da5b7258f30cfe5eb2f7bba" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effects of Healthy and Unhealthy Food on Female Body Image and Mood State</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.107.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hayes, Jacqueline</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9add7466e10c34ed540021e392bc7370">In a society now plagued with both obesity and eating disorders, the topic of female body image has become particularly salient. Historically believed to be a trait characteristic, research has shown that female body image can be impacted by day-to-day events, including food intake, especially in those with a restrained eating style. The present study examined this phenomenon in more detail, specifically with regards to typically healthy and unhealthy foods and their effect on state body image. Female participants were recruited to partake in an experiment believed to assess the effect of certain foods on cognition and were given a healthy or unhealthy snack or were placed in a control no food condition. The healthy and unhealthy foods were of similar caloric content. Subjects participated in three cognitive tasks but were also asked to report their state body image, mood, perceived body size both before and after eating the snack. Additionally, they answered a number of other surveys designed to hide the true interest of the study. Results indicate that intake of unhealthy food impacts female body image in a negative manner whereas intake of a healthy food and no food at all elicit no change. Furthermore, after eating an unhealthy snack women displayed a decrease in depressive mood state. Additional research on restraint, BMI, and healthy eater status is discussed.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9723139a860ad3fa4085a9defdcc4071"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a7d23e7a50c3761362757c5cd2696375" level="item"><did><unittitle>Intergroup Interactions with Dual Identity Outgroup Individuals</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.108.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mohr, Rebecca</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e94790ddfa1dd1e3234c4853485866aa">Previous studies have found that certain patterns emerge when people participate in intergroup interactions.

Sixty-three straight male undergraduates at Tufts University interacted with a confederate who they believed to be another participant. The sexual orientation of the confederate was manipulated such that participants believed that he was straight, gay, or bisexual (the dual identity-bisexual).

Sex was examined as a plausible moderator of each social support domain and body dysmorphic symptom severity. Results showed significant, negative correlations between perceived social support from friends and significant others and BDD symptom severity for males. Among females, results demonstrated negative correlations between perceived social support from family and friends and BDD symptom severity. Additionally, sex moderated the association between perceived social support from significant others and symptom severity, such that there was a significant negative association for males, but not females.

This preference may be a result of cognitive decline, motivational shifts, or enhanced valence salience in old age.  Two experiments used modified versions of the Tversky and Kahneman (1981) framing-effect paradigm to compare both older and younger participants' reliance on gain/loss framing as a potential heuristic.  Experiment 1 included alternating secondary tasks that were either calculation-based or memory-based.  These tasks were intended to prime motivational states, respectively, toward goals of mathematical analysis, which would enhance awareness of misleading frames, or verbal memory, which would provide no advantage in making a framed choice.  Experiment 2 included instructional manipulations to complete the task using either critical reasoning or intuition.  Analysis of the data revealed that manipulations that primed analytical processing (i.e. the probabilistic task in Experiment 1 and reasoning instructions in Experiment 2) reduced the effect of risk framing in older adults, but demonstrated no change in effect in younger adults.  These findings suggest that older adults may be able to overcome reliance on decision aids under conditions that reinforce advantageous motivation states.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f2d1ed369afbc0c910fc01ddf56460bc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8c16bec98570ebbafe3287aaeafe375f" level="item"><did><unittitle>The role of glutamate via the NMDA receptor in aggressive behavior after ethanol consumption in mice</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.112.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bahamon, Brittany N.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0cfbc5b44b180dac700551e207721a41">Alcohol has been linked to two-thirds of violence in humans (Krug et al., 2002). However, only certain individuals are more likely than others to engage in aggressive behavior after drinking (Cloninger, 1987). Mice that display more than two standard deviations of aggressive behavior after ethanol drinking compared to water drinking can be considered alcohol-heightened aggressive (AHA) mice (Miczek et al., 1998) and are clinically relevant models. Serotonergic projections from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are involved in modulation of aggression. Because the N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has been implicated in ethanol-associated phenomena such as tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, craving, and relapse (Trujillo et al., 1995; Krystal et al., 2003, this study sought to examine the role of glutamate via the NMDAR in alcohol-heightened aggression in mice. Because ethanol antagonizes the NMDAR (Lovinger et al., 1989; Follesa &amp; Ticku, 1996; Kumari &amp; Ticku, 1998; Roberto et al., 2004; Qiang &amp; Ticku, 2005), researchers expected an increase in aggressive behavior after alcohol consumption.  Male CFW mice were trained to self-administer 1 g/kg of 6% EtOH or the equivalent volume of water. In the first experiment, mice were systemically injected with memantine (1,3,10,17 mg/kg) immediately after drinking and then confronted with an intruder mouse in the home cage. Aggressive behavior significantly increased at the lower doses of memantine (1 and 3 mg/kg) after ethanol but not water consumption. In the second experiment, mice were microinjected with AP-5 (0.1,1&amp;#x03bc;g) in the DRN. There was a significant drug effect in AHA animals but not in ANA animals. This study suggests that glutamate specifically via the NMDAR may have a role in regulating alcohol-heightened aggression in mice; however, this role may not be limited to the NMDAR or the DRN.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2e3c02c3c2ed9281d7289385db01b913"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4175e9820811211316942e5de1066781" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Multimodal Analysis of the Time-Course and Neuroanatomy of Real-World Comprehension and its Implications for Schizophrenia</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.113.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Perrone, Christopher Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8e4d6675ed055eb31a8a9a94495337a2">Deficits in real-world knowledge may underlie both abnormal comprehension and behavior in schizophrenia, contributing to patients' disability. Previous findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia may under-recruit dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when comprehension requires knowledge of principles of goal-directed actions. One possible explanation for this is that patients were distracted by goal-irrelevant but salient aspects of visual scenes (e.g., patterns of object motion) and consequently adopted a less optimal comprehension strategy. Characterizing the rapid spatiotemporal neural dynamics during real-world comprehension can help to examine this possibility. Here we present high-temporal-resolution multimodal-imaging data in healthy participants that motivate applying this paradigm to schizophrenia. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) were recorded simultaneously while participants reported whether they understood the goals of activities depicted in short video-clips that included either usual or unconventional objects and object-specific or non-specific actions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to account for individual differences in cortical folding and head shape when analyzing EEG/MEG activity. Late positivity in event-related potentials revealed increased efforts for integrating unconventional objects and non-specific actions. Analysis of EEG and MEG statistical parametric maps localized activity in response to conventional objects and object-specific actions in the temporal cortex (implicated in the knowledge of objects) at ~300ms, while unconventional objects and non-specific motions were linked to later activity in the DLPFC. Thus, it is possible that familiar yet goal-irrelevant aspects of real-world activities, which are processed rapidly in temporal cortex, may draw processing resources away from the later DLPFC-mediated analysis.

A cardinal feature of schizophrenia is misattributing internal thoughts, emotions, and actions to an external source. In the current study, we examined the underlying cognitive bases of this bias during mental simulation of real-world actions. Previously, it has been found that healthy adults take on an observer's (external) perspective when reading simple, action statements preceded by "He" and a performer's perspective (internal) perspective when reading statements preceded by "You" (Brunye et al., 2009). We predicted that patients with schizophrenia would be prone to adopt an observer's perspective, regardless of the pronoun preceding the action statement. Methods: Patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder were recruited from the Psychosis and Bipolar Disorder Unit at McLean Hospital. Healthy controls were recruited from Craiglist.org. Participants read simple, real-world action statements preceded by the pronoun "You" or "He." Following each statement, participants were instructed to verify whether a picture, depicted in either a performer's or observer's perspective, matched the action described in the sentence. Results: Unlike healthy controls and patients with bipolar disorder, patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were faster at verifying pictures from an observer's perspective relative to pictures from a performer's perspective, regardless of the preceding pronoun. Conclusions: We extend previous findings of an external misattribution bias in patients with schizophrenia using a task that did not rely on patients' explicit judgments of their subjective experiences. Although it appears that this bias is related to diagnosis, more research is needed to determine the extent to which this bias is influenced by specific symptoms.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_497f1c4bbeeec7912de268a863a871c0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4a40c5bd2c2fa2adf9a6b50e69949502" level="item"><did><unittitle>Language Effects in Second Language Learners: A Longitudinal ERP Study</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.115.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Soskey, Laura N.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010" type="inclusive">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b469de0f21fa06db2af3fb585259de22">Are the mechanisms involved in word recognition in early L2 learners different from those of more proficient L2 users and how do these mechanisms evolve during learning?  Our study sought to closely track language effects in beginning learners of an L2.  In the present study both behavioral and ERP data were collected to investigate the changes over time of L2 processing in beginning learners.  Monolingual L1 English-speakers enrolled in introductory Spanish at Tufts University were first trained on a list of 228 Spanish words and their English translations.  These critical items were chosen from the vocabulary to be learned in their introductory Spanish class over the course of the semester.  Behavioral data from this training session and the following experimental sessions showed expected learning effects.  In the three subsequent experimental sessions the participants saw three lists - an English list, a Spanish list, and a mixed language list, performing a go/no-go lexical decision task.  As observed in previous studies our results showed overall larger negativities in the N400 epoch to L1 items than to L2 items.  The differences varied in that amplitudes in the traditional N400 epoch to L2 items became more negative over the course of the semester.  These results suggest that L2 items become more connected in the mental lexicon rapidly in the earliest stages of learning a second language, emphasizing the plasticity of the mature brain.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5f28666d565f1f2f31221a3178e3ac9b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3a655ab307ee345fa0bdbd9f6044eea7" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effect of Emotion on Memory: Faces and Names</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.116.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nitenson, Adam Z.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a9bd467578fb8705d492999cc18479ac">Emotion has been shown to demonstrate a modulating effect on memory, generally enhancing recall and recognition of stimuli.

It was predicted that there would be a significant main difference for race, skin tone, and education level. It was also predicted that there would be a significant interaction between all three variables. A mean difference was found for skin tone, in which the mean difference was higher for light skin tone than dark skin tone. A significant interaction was found between skin tone and level of education, in which only light skinned targets were evaluated differently based on education level.

The results provide evidence that will support future research in the topic of leadership and race that can help determine what attributes hinder leaders in their political pursuits.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e70b4f9da113d420c54f9221b8b774ac"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b821e523e18a7c4ad0c695870061311a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Avian Visual Cognition: Shape from Shading in the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris)</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.118.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Qadri, Muhammad A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0177b926a5c758fa4911681d01f84ec1">"Shape from shading" is the ability to integrate the pattern of light reflected by a surface and with light source information to derive the object's structure. This study explores this ability in five European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a model passerine species previously used once in our lab (Khan, 2009). The focus of the current study was to follow the experiments from Cook, Commons-Miller, Kieres (2009) where this ability was studied in pigeons. This study used an operant chamber in a closed-economy feeding system which used perching as the response behavior. The study established that starlings are able to discriminate concavities from convexities and, using transfer tests to categorically similar stimuli, confirms that the starlings are responding to concavity and convexity.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_41b7982b9ee8b1b6c76e3c5c6838bf7c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8c8a3574127cef5b2ac0cc682559a6bd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Affective State and the Encoding and Retrieval of Spatial Information from Campus Maps</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.119.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lokhande, Kiran J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_12aa066f385af4328ddff18cd3a46180">While previous studies demonstrate some relationship between mood, arousal, and spatial memory, the exact mechanisms of local and global spatial perception remain unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether the effects seen are caused by an allocation of visual attention towards the global or local elements of a stimulus, or whether the effect is due solely to organizational schemas created in memory. The present study manipulated arousal and mood to examine the role of visual attention and mental schemas in spatial memory. In the study, participants examined a college map while an eyetracker recorded their eye movements. Afterwards, they underwent free recall and spatial statement verification memory tests. Eyetracking results demonstrated that high arousal states cause participants to narrow their focus and produce smaller saccade amplitudes during study. However, memory test results found that participants under high arousal were able to more quickly recognize landmark relationships over long relative to short distances. The conflicting results show the role of both visual attention and mental schemas in spatial memory and has implications for the design of future research examining both factors.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_77943232bc02b4a3584cb6e46c6751f8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_27a05bf3afdd98f49b8cd9e8c4523349" level="item"><did><unittitle>Infants' Understanding of the Goal-Directed Nature of Walking: Does Action Production Facilitate Action Perception?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.120.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rodini, Joseph Francis</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_61e901ad75a92560fab807092d6e1ac6">Adults are adept at seeing beyond the simple surface characteristics of others' behavior to interpret underlying beliefs, desires, and intentions. To date, much prior research has attempted to trace the origins of theory of mind in infancy, particularly infants' understanding of others' goal-directed behavior. In this study, a demonstrator modeled a previously unexplored, "macro" human behavior-walking-in order to explore whether it is appreciated as goal-directed among infants. This contrasts with previous research, which has focused on "micro" behaviors such as reaching and grasping. In addition to identifying a new behavior perceived as goal-directed early in life, this project also serves as evidence in the inquiry as to the mechanism by which infants acquire goal-directed behavioral understanding in others. Recent research suggests that infants' own experience with and mastery of behaviors allows for an understanding of the same behaviors when performed by other people. This study tested the self-experience hypothesis by examining the understandings of separate groups of infants who could and could not yet walk. Results did not support the research hypothesis that walkers are capable of perceiving another's walking as goal-directed. The discussion focuses on study limitations that may have caused the null findings.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d1939d9ae7c5ee72a51ed43facefcc15"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_464f48a8598077232703ba8f2afedeac" level="item"><did><unittitle>Alcohol, metabotropic glutamate receptors and aggression in mice</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.121.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Newman, Emily</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Takahashi, Aki</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">DeBold, Joseph F.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Miczek, Klaus A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_208a1c1491304db3924fa0cd4838f811" label="Books [3909015518026b]" type="box">Volume 121</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_406738c0002422b43862347bfdb652e2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Psychology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a4c0aac4db2ab17dd9b5e8808a193b20" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effect of Social Awareness on Infant Synchronous Imitation</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.122.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Velayo, Bianca C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_baf61ff6cce6ad9dee3e1f5c33b7fc45">Infants use imitation to learn object affordances and to communicate so that they can become better connected to their environment. In this experiment, I looked at 17-19 month old infants' responses to three different imitation paradigms to study social influences in infant imitation. Furthermore, the present study explored infants' utilization of synchronous imitation as a communicative outlet. The findings show that infants formed a preference for an object previously modeled on by an experimenter and infants took a significantly longer time to imitate when presented with an object prior to any demonstration compared to their performance in the other imitation paradigms. Consistent with my hypothesis, I found that the more social infants engaged in sustained synchronous imitation compared to their less social peers. Additionally, the more social infants received lower synchronous imitation scores when presented with novel stimuli. The results suggest that both social and cognitive skills are involved in communicating via synchronous imitation. These findings have implications in pedagogical approaches.

This paper investigates the processing of the word some and under what contexts six to nine year olds interpret the term to be and not be consistent with the term all. Previous online processing tasks and offline judgment task research suggests that listeners start to understand some to mean only a subset and not a whole set sometime shortly after age five (Huang &amp; Snedeker, 2009b; Huang, Spelke, &amp; Snedeker, n.d.; Noveck, 2001; Papafragou &amp; Musolino, 2003; Pouscoulous, Noveck, Politzer &amp; Bastide, 2007). By creating new experiments based off of two previously run paradigms (Huang &amp; Snedeker, 2009; Huang, Spelke, &amp; Snedeker, n.d.) we compared online and offline data of six to nine year olds' interpretations of the word some to find that this age range of children does not make implicatures during processing, but seem to make them during offline tasks by age eight and possibly earlier. These results suggest that six to nine year olds either need specific contexts or extended time to make such implicatures and give us insight into what contexts may be useful for priming or teaching such pragmatic interpretations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_00f2145d7c6769f61d73d8d9b10fa7ed"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Pyscholinguistics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6182ff94e55389aacb12f7386644a4d5" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effects of Stereotypes and Audience-Pressure on Athletic Performance: Threat, Lift, and Choking Under Pressure</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.124.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gainsburg, Izzy B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_07bba0f9ecb51dfe61005e19214bb19a">The present study examines how positive ingroup and positive outgroup stereotypes interact with audience-induced pressure to affect athletic performance. In sport the effects of negative stereotypes and pressure are well researched, but the effects of positive stereotypes and the interactions between stereotypes and pressure are less researched. Specifically, it remains an open question as to whether positive ingroup stereotypes will enhance or impair performance, particularly in high-pressure situations. In the current study, White males shot an initial baseline set of free throws. They then watched a video either purporting a positive basketball stereotype about White basketball players, a video purporting a positive basketball stereotype about Black basketball players, or a neutral sports video. Following the video, participants shot a second set of free throws, during which half the participants were overtly videotaped for an Internet audience in order to induce an audience-pressure. We predicted positive ingroup stereotypes would cause stereotype lift in low-pressure situations, but cause choking in high-pressure situations. We predicted that positive outgroup stereotypes would hurt performance, and that these effects would be amplified by audience-pressure. Results supported these hypotheses, although audience-pressure did not significantly intensify decrements in participants primed with the positive outgroup stereotype. Discussion examines the potential limits of choking and threat, the contrasting effects of lift and choking inspired by positive ingroup stereotypes, and directions for future research.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a9e5da763b1a7bc37491bdc841b3f8d4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</subject><subject source="local">Sports</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8a30875d1b0846c0e4266bc830d9c4c7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Predicting Choice: Distraction and Reappraisal as Strategies for Emotion Regulation</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.125.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Yih, Jennifer</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3997d396f2ad634b4aca59d38d53d8f7">The present study was designed to examine to what extent the valence and arousal dimensions of high and low emotion pictures predict the strategies people choose to regulate their emotions.

Glucocorticoids mediate many physiological changes in response to environmental challenges. Ultimately, they provide negative feedback to the brain regions that activate the HPA axis. When secreted chronically, however, glucocorticoids can damage neurons that regulate the axis. This possibility may be magnified during developmental critical periods, when the brain is most sensitive to environmental influences. Studies in animals suggest adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects chronic stress. The present study hypothesized that adolescents exposed to chronic activation of the HPA axis would exhibit heightened reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST). The accumulation of cortisol in hair was used as a biomarker of chronic activation of the HPA axis in order to investigate its relationship with subjective reports of stress and its impact on subsequent reactivity.

A total of 153 participants (two were excluded from analyses) completed a judgment task where they read a summary of a hypothetical criminal offense and assigned a prison sentence, as well as rated their perception of the severity of the crime and impression of the defendant.   A 3 x 2 factorial design was used in which participants were split into three conditions based on distraction; group one received no-distraction, group two was faced with a mental distraction and, group three was physically distracted.  Half of each of these groups was exposed to either a White or Black defendant.  Next, participants completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to evaluate implicit biases.  We hypothesized that individuals who were mentally or physically distracted would give longer prison sentences and less favorable impressions of the crime and the defendant when he was Black as opposed to White, than non-distracted participants.  The results did not support the hypothesis as no statistically significant interaction was found between distraction and the defendant's race in regards to the dependent measures.  The mental and physical distractions may have failed to cognitively tax the participants enough to promote enhanced use of judgment heuristics and stereotyping.  Future research directions are discussed that present alternative explorations of this relationship.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9ee1e246d396514c61bb73c5a2aa3b79"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_210eb1df2487c60b76af450b0aa4047f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Do Morphological Differences in Brain Structures in PTSD Arise from a Familial Predisposition or from the Disorder Itself?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.128.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Staples, Lindsay Katharine</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_00b854fae5578d1def0a1d3161878457">The cingulate cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala have each been implicated in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study examines morphological differences in these regions of interest in monozygotic twins discordant for trauma exposure and PTSD. We hypothesized that reduced volumes in the cingulate would represent acquired characteristics of PTSD and that reduced volumes in the hippocampus would represent a familial predisposition to the disorder. Subjects included identical twin pairs in which (1) the combat-exposed co-twin developed PTSD and the combat-unexposed co-twin did not; and (2) the combat-exposed co-twin never developed PTSD and the combat-unexposed cotwin also did not have PTSD. Differences between PTSD pairs and control pairs will indicate a familial predisposition to abnormalities in the cingulate, hippocampus, and amygdala. Differences between trauma-exposed and unexposed subjects will reflect characteristics acquired after trauma. If individuals with PTSD show significantly different volumes from their brothers as well as from subjects in control pairs, it will indicate that these brain abnormalities are an acquired characteristic of the disorder. In the right rostral and right dorsal anterior cingulate, we found main effects of PTSD Diagnosis in which PTSD twin pairs had larger volumes than non-PTSD pairs. In the right rACC, there was a PTSD Diagnosis x Exposure interaction in the rACC indicating that larger right rACC volumes may be an acquired characteristic of PTSD. Subjects with PTSD but not their brothers had significantly larger right rACC volumes than combat-exposed and unexposed controls. There was an inconsistent result in the left dACC that showed greater volumes in non-PTSD pairs. We also found larger posterior cingulate thickness non-PTSD pairs than PTSD pairs. There was also a main effect of Exposure in the right posterior cingulate with unexposed subjects showing larger volumes than exposed subjects. There was a main effect of Exposure in the right hippocampus in which exposed subjects exhibited larger volumes than unexposed subjects. There were no significant effects in the amygdala. These findings overall did not support our hypotheses and conflict with previous literature on these regions of interest. These results require replication, however may be explained by low symptom severity, effects of treatment, or may demonstrate abnormalities found in unremitting forms of PTSD. The mixed results found in this investigation point to the need for further study of structural differences in these regions of interest.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_410357322cf88e96a4537e6c026c7095"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Post-traumatic stress disorder</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7a6e50939b380896747ac386ee0641b4" level="item"><did><unittitle>To Look, But Not to Learn: The Impact of Televised Formal Features on Attention and Comprehension of Infant Learning Paradigms</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.129.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">III, Marcos Sastre,</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_768578831f3485e15791e685207b7a10">Young infants (under 2 years old) are widely underrepresented in media research, a fact that has spurned numerous debates on the effects of screen viewing on development. Past literature has indicated that the degree of perceptual salience on video is the most robust mediator of infant attention. Nevertheless, attention is not a reliable predictor of comprehension by itself; rather, the different audiovisual properties of the stimulus can have varying effects on processing information from a video source. The current study aims to isolate how formal features, 'syntactic' elements of design and production, affect attention and comprehension of video demonstrations on two forced choice imitation/search tasks. Infants were shown a series of six short video clips, each modified with one of four experimental conditions (two visual, two auditory): Cartoon Voice, Music, Visual Effects, Artificial Dynamics, and Music, and two control trials. Results indicated that unexpectedly, attention to the medium was high overall, with few condition effects (Hypothesis 1), but, as predicted, imposition of formal features resulted in poorer performance on all trials except the Cartoon Voice condition (Hypothesis 2). Condition differences were also observed for task performance, as expected (Hypothesis 3). These findings suggest that children are capable of learning from video, but this ability is markedly affected by the audiovisual conventions that often accompany commercial products. The implications of these findings in light of the controversies surrounding infant-direct media are discussed.

Complex sounds are sounds that differ continuously over the course of their duration.  In animals such as songbirds, this processing is paramount to understanding the calls of their conspecifics.  This study examines recent data using procedures originally by Cook and Brooks (2009) to test for complex sound processing in pigeons, vocal nonlearners with no capacity for song.  Four pigeons (Columbia livia) were trained in a go/no-go task in which they successfully learned to peck at sequences of different sounds and withhold pecking during same-sound sequences of complex stimuli.  Repetitive (same) trials were analyzed to see what factors influenced the birds pecking.  The study found that pigeons suppressed pecking more on birdsong stimuli versus artificial complex sounds and largely ignored local patterns in sound, ostensibly demonstrating that pigeons too demonstrated a holistic ability to integrate sounds over time into comparable units.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8a5b141c29d6d543b4961255b662f2c2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Auditory perception</subject><subject source="local">Pigeons</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_937ee85e9f5d64bed7ed6be52030887d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Psychological Outcomes for Participants in Groups for Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.133.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Liu, Sabrina Ruixia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b419c4a097465a4617fd1ef8679d33ef">Effects of domestic violence are diverse and damaging to one's life (Briere &amp; Jordan, 2004), yet the research in this field is limited (Abel, 2000).

Data analysis was performed to determine if the level of participants' depression or self-esteem changed from before to after group participation. This study also examined whether the amount of change in participants' depression or self-esteem levels differed across a variety of situational and demographic factors. Data analysis was also performed to determine if participants' baseline levels of depression, self-esteem, or perceived safety differed significantly between participants who dropped out of the groups and those who stayed in the groups. Finally, the study examined whether participants' baseline levels of self-esteem, depression, perceived safety, or income differed significantly across various demographic variables of participants. Analysis showed that mean depression and self-esteem scores of participants improved significantly in both groups. Participants who dropped out of the support group had felt less safe at baseline than those who stayed in the group, and participants who dropped out of the self-defense group had more severe depression and lower self-esteem at baseline than those who completed the group. These findings have useful implications for those trying to address the negative effects of intimate partner violence (IPV), in the fields of both treatment and research. Results of this study confirm existing research claims that support groups have positive effects on self-esteem and depression levels of IPV victims. It also brings some new information to light – this is the first study in the literature to look at the psychological effect of self-defense groups for victimized women. It is also the first study to consider baseline safety rating as a predictor of dropping out. These findings should be taken into account when designing future studies in the field of IPV or when trying to create an effective IPV therapy program.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0321a48040452c32b2b4c2987eed2a10"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Family violence</subject><subject source="local">Rehabilitation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c7d0562a62b4733c59186b382d2fe21d" level="item"><did><unittitle>GABA-A alpha-5 subunit manipulation of maternal separation-induced anxiety in mice</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.134.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sloley, Stephanie S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c15835a50248a9ab7866f6ddc940fb30">Rodent models were used to examine the role of alpha-5 subunit containing GABAA receptors in modulating anxiety-like behavior through the maternal separation procedure, a reliable model for eliciting early life stress in rodents (Levine, 1957).  In the brief separation procedure, subjects were separated from the dam and tested following subcutaneous injections of  0, 3, 5.6, 10, 17 or 30 mg/kg  of the alpha-5 subunit preferential antagonist Xli-093, or injections of 0, 3 or 10 mg/kg of the alpha-5 subunit preferential agonist SH-053-2'F-R-CH3. During testing, the number of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) was recorded, as well as locomotor activity and motor coordination. In the long-term separation procedure, subjects underwent timed, daily separations, while control subjects were left undisturbed until weaning. Both groups were tested as adults in an open-field paradigm using the Xli-093 compound. In both experiments, no significant differences were found between any of the dose groups or conditions; however a trend towards a peak in USV production occurring at the 5.6 mg/kg dose of Xli-093 in the brief separation experiment was observed. Further testing is required in order to determine whether modulation of the GABAA alpha-5 subunit has an effect on anxiety-like behavior.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_739979ab08bda16cc2593e27badee8ac"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Anxiety</subject><subject source="local">Mother and child</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_86afcbd4806e8efb2473776fd257f355" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of CRF-R1 and Opioid Antagonism on Alcohol Intake in C57BL/6J Mice</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.135.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kayyali, Tala M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6c682d12d15d04db27a43b8d095a7a58">Modulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neural pathways and the opioid system has been promising for reducing ethanol intake in alcohol-dependent rodents and humans. Specifically, CRF receptor 1 (CRF-R1) antagonism in brain sites such as the dorsal raphé nucleus (DRN) has been suggested to alter output involved in alcohol drinking. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is a drug that is currently being used in the treatment of alcoholism. This research explores the role of antagonism of CRF-R1 and the opiate system in the DRN as they affect ethanol consumption in C57BL/6J mice. In a series of experiments, animals were given intermittent access to alcohol. After establishing stable drinking levels, mice received systemic injections of naltrexone (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 mg/kg) and then were implanted with guide cannulae into the DRN. Different doses of a CRF-R1 antagonist and naltrexone were infused intra-DRN to test for a reduction of alcohol consumption. Measures of withdrawal and blood ethanol concentration were taken to verify the alcoholism model in mice. Another batch underwent surgery after achieving stable drinking levels, then received intra-DRN infusions using different doses of CP-154,526, naltrexone, or a combination. Current findings indicate that both CP 154,526 and naltrexone are effective in significantly reducing ethanol intake, but do not affect water intake. The combination of both did not show an additive effect, but it did result in a greater reduction in ethanol intake than each drug had individually. This could mean that CRF and opioid receptors work independently on serotonin in the DRN. Future studies could investigate other areas where CRF and opioid receptors are co-localized such as the central amygdala or the locus coeruleus.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_feea8b46d644783a3baddff42300f44b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Alcoholism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3cdbf961987e768fd8e3d10420598a3b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Equity on Autopilot: Skin Tone and the Implicit Operation of Egalitarian Goals</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.136.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mann, Thomas C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_20eef2b09210cdeaaf96c60c19ec1929">Research on racial phenotypicality bias (Maddox, 2004) has shown that within-race variation in facial physiognomy moderates stereotype activation and use; more prototypical category members elicit greater stereotyping.  In contrast to between-race bias, within-race bias based on features has proven especially difficult to consciously control.  The present experiment applied research on implicit motivation to explore the control of racial phenotypicality bias, examining both individual differences in implicit motivation and manipulated implicit goals.  Participants completed a primed lexical decision task designed to measure the association between Black stereotypes and Black faces with light or dark skin tones, as well as implicit and explicit measures of chronic egalitarian motivation.  Participants were also subliminally primed with either an egalitarian or control goal to replicate the effect of the individual difference with a manipulated version of the goal. Results provided the first evidence of stereotyping based on phenotypicality using an implicit measure, and suggested that those with chronic implicit egalitarian goals can control this bias even outside of awareness, while primed egalitarianism had no effect on stereotype activation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6838bec415ed976652514463cc3bcbe6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</subject><subject source="local">Race</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_652db64a163b104d0f562bd09e9aaeff" level="item"><did><unittitle>About time we make sense: Distinct neural processes engaged during temporal sequencing and coherence building in discourse</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.137.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fairbrother, Wonja M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ae4135ebadbfa92578f9bbae7d281c82">In the real world, causes always come before effects, while in communication, events can be described in either this canonical temporal order using causal connectors such as "and so", or in non-canonical order using connectors like "because". Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we determined whether the canonical sequencing of events influences the establishment of causal coherence, or vice versa, during online discourse processing. Two-clause cause/effect sentences were created, in which we fully crossed temporal sequencing of events with discourse coherence, yielding four experimental conditions (example set: Fred was hungry [and so/*because] he ate...; Fred ate [*and so/because] he was hungry..."). 32 participants read these sentences, presented word-by-word (450ms, ISI: 100ms), and made acceptability judgments at the end of each sentence. Participants' working memory spans were assessed with an Automated Reading Span task. At anterior electrode sites, ERPs to critical words ("ate/hungry") in clauses appearing in non-canonical sequence evoked a larger sustained negativity starting between 400-500ms than in clauses appearing in canonical temporal sequence. At centro-parietal sites, ERPs to critical words in incoherent clauses evoked a larger negativity between 300-500ms (an N400 effect) and a larger positivity between 700-900ms (a P600 effect) than in coherent clauses. A main effect of working memory span between 200-300ms after the critical word and sentence-final word did not interact with either coherence or canonicity. Together, these results suggest that during discourse comprehension, establishing the temporal sequencing of events and establishing their causal coherence are driven by distinct neural mechanisms and are not influenced by individual differences in working memory span.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_dd657c7cc6a231ada28047165b515a61"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Discourse analysis</subject><subject source="local">Psychological aspects</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4bbeaf29545044a751c248f4d4e9ee46" level="item"><did><unittitle>Selective Interference Effects on Working Memory during Navigation</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.138.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fitzgerald, Michael W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f2b6aa124ec58590465089a36f6bdd9c">The present study used dual-tasking to examine the involvement of working memory components in navigation based learning and recall processes.

Stereotype threat _�_ the situational phenomenon whereby excessive anxiety about inadvertently confirming an existing negative stereotype regarding one_�_s group ultimately hinders ability _�_ can be elicited among any individual invested in a task associated with an identity-relevant negative stereotype. Stereotypes can be conveyed through communicative mediums such as music, which has become increasingly widespread, accessible, and influential in North American society. Thus, the present study aimed to determine whether popular songs containing female-specific negative stereotypes would be sufficient to induce stereotype threat in highly qualified young women taking a domain-relevant mathematics test. It was hypothesized that these women would perform more poorly on a difficult quantitative task while listening to background music casting females in negative stereotypical roles as opposed to background music depicting females in positions of empowerment. Furthermore, it was predicted that young men would be unaffected by the female-specific stereotypes and perform similarly across all music conditions. Support for both hypotheses was generated. Implications and future directions were discussed.

Within each half, there was one block in which pictures were named in L1 and one in which pictures were named in L2.  Language switch was manipulated by language of the prime word, which switched randomly and unpredictably between L1 and L2.  A frontal N2 was found for switch trials in the L1-L2 direction only, and switch effects were more prevalent in the semantic categorization task than the language decision task.

Holding such beliefs has been shown to have a variety of negative consequences, including increased stereotype endorsement, increased prejudice, and decreased interest in interracial interactions (Keller, 2005; Jayaratne et al, 2006; Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008). This past research has experimentally manipulated race essentialism by presenting participants with written arguments for or against race essentialism. The present studies investigate an alternative manipulation of race essentialism: mere exposure to faces. In study 1, participants exposed to a set of faces of prototypical phenotype (creating distinct racial boundaries) had a higher endorsement of race essentialism than did participants exposed to a set of faces of variable phenotype (blurring racial boundaries). Study 2 provides evidence that perceptually blurring boundaries only reduces race essentialism if there are no social cues to category division. Finally, in study 3, participants exposed to faces of prototypical phenotype were more emotionally disengaged after reading a passage about racial inequalities. These studies provide evidence that lay theories about race can be affected by passive everyday exposure.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f43e957e626cd7d3e356a53cfde582dc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_6eef93e990d3acda29794da6dd58d0d7" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Study of the Factors That Influence Levels of Environmental Action</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.142.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chevalier, Lydia L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_102876483fa461c3d0d0f3596dab61f6">As the number of environmental problems in the world increases, it is important that the general public becomes more environmentally active to combat these problems.

Participants consisted of 314 Tufts University undergraduate and graduate students who took a survey to evaluate their levels of environmental action, environmental knowledge, accuracy of environmental perceptions, personal beliefs and personal values.  Results suggest that the choice to participate in an environmental group leads to higher levels of environmental action, but that the choice to major in Environmental Studies does not have any impact on environmental action levels.  Additionally, participants majoring in Environmental Studies did not have higher levels of environmental knowledge than non-majors.  Unexpectedly, participants in environmental groups thought that environmental action was less important than participants who were not in environmental groups, despite higher levels of environmental action in the former.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6210d9dd233477435026df8c9f30130a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_cd8351dc6f90526c13539f16d69bedbd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Learning and Action Correction in Routine Tasks: New Changes to the Contention Scheduling Model</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.143.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Taylor, Matthew E.W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_af14947c756f36c200948f6aea45a1de">Sequential, routine tasks are part of our every day life _�_ putting on clothes, driving to work, making coffee, making dinner, etc. They are the definition of ordinary and trivial goals.

One model, Contention Scheduling, is considered a successful computational model of routine task implementation, demonstrating ordinary action selection, as well as errors in implementation we observe in humans. However, the model has its own deficiencies with regards to learning and action correction. The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of Hebbian learning and bottom-up connections in modifying Contention Scheduling to resolve these issues. In order to do this, we implemented our own version of the original model, as well as versions including learning and action correction, and compared the results. Our results indicate that Hebbian learning complements the model well to simulate the cognition of procedural learning, and that bottom-up connections mitigate a large portion of the observed errors in the model.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c1fc0e6c78953a8ba7fd088974df94cc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_812b6fb191a33814ef4ec2bac58de60a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of Communication Mode on Stereotyping of Deaf Individuals</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.144.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sherb, Alexandra</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_847f0f6c627e366f8d752e12045899ff">The current study examined the effects of text- and video-based communication on the perception of Deaf and hearing individuals, with the larger goal of examining how these individuals may be stereotyped by perceivers.

Previously published studies report that typically developing adults, children, and even infants rely on prosody to provide additionally relevant information that is not evident from language structures (i.e. words, grammar, etc.) alone (Speer &amp; Ito, 1999).  The intonational phrase boundary (primarily pause) is a prosodic cue that helps to delineate boundaries between words or phrases in stream of a fluent speech (Wilkinson, 1998).  Based on previous finding that the lexical and syntactic elements of language are not impaired in individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) (Thurber &amp; Tager-Flusberg, 1993), it is hypothesized that these same individuals have no impairment in their ability to detect and process pause as a prosodic cue. The present study tests whether children, ages 6-9, with HFA (N=27) can effectively process an intonational phrase boundary to resolve ambiguous syntactic phrasing.  It also compares the trajectory of on-line processing by HFA children with typically developing, same-aged peers (N=29), and peers of a slightly younger age (ages 4-5; N=16).  Both TD and HFA children, ages 6-9, effectively use an intonational phrase boundary to signal the early syntactic closure of a phrase, but it takes children with HFA approximately 100 ms longer to process this cue.  By contrast, young TD children do not appear to be able to use prosodic cue at any point during the two-clause presentation.  These observations support the hypothesis that, by ages 6-9, HFA children are developmentally on-track with typically developing children of the same age, who use prosody for syntactic phrasing.  However, their need for slightly more time suggests that the children with HFA may not be using the entire prosodic cue as efficiently as TD peers.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cd0abbcfdd92efa04632ca36282b8c32"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_f481062216707738e079f8032b6e6e07" level="item"><did><unittitle>Variations in Probability Judgment</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.148.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, Brianna Alesia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_412a1226f4f07b92aefadfa2351c4b71">This research is a study of accuracy in probability judgment.

In two experiments, participants were briefly shown a field of marbles and then asked to make judgments about the probability of selecting a certain type of marble from that field. Participants made far more accurate judgments in this task than has been typically found in the existing social-based probability literature. Participants committed very few decision-making fallacies, and their accuracy was neither significantly affected by more difficult presentation modes nor strongly impacted by delays between presentation and test. This finding shows support for the representativeness theory of the conjunction fallacy in decision making. Meanwhile, this result undermines the arguments of other theorists who have assumed that fallacies are due to an essential human difficulty with probability or probability integration.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0b227959df946c992e8a8ec7dd387d4f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_ecccc8ffb4eb459060c41ac5cb0ab582" level="item"><did><unittitle>Role of Glutamate Receptors in a Mouse Model of Alcohol-Heightened Aggression</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.149.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hewage, Nishani B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2839411e2a41d65d6bfb1bfb94bcc571">Serotonin is the neurotransmitter most implicated in the neural mechanism of aggressive behavior, including the heightened aggressive behavior that occurs in some individuals after alcohol consumption. Recent data suggest that the glutamate NMDA receptor (NMDAR) may modulate the serotonergic pathway involved in alcohol-heightened aggression. The objective of the present study was to further characterize the role of the NMDAR in alcohol-heightened aggression via pharmacological manipulations at the NMDAR in a series of preclinical studies. Male Swiss-Webster mice self-administered 1.0 g/kg (w/v) ethanol and were assessed for aggressive behavior using the resident-intruder paradigm, a translational rodent model of aggression. D-Cycloserine (0-100 mg/kg), ifenprodil (0-10 mg/kg), and amantadine (0-30 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally immediately following ethanol self-administration to investigate the effects of manipulations at the NMDAR glycine-binding site, NR2B subunit, and channel pore, respectively. While these compounds did not significantly interact with ethanol to affect aggressive behavior, further investigations are warranted before relegating these sites as irrelevant in alcohol-heightened aggression. Specifically, in a subpopulation of mice characterized as alcohol-heightened aggressors (AHA), ethanol significantly blocked the apparent anti-aggressive effect of D-cycloserine. Furthermore, 17 mg/kg amantadine significantly increased aggressive behavior after ethanol drinking compared to water drinking, and a similar trend was seen after 0.3 mg/kg ifenprodil. Given the individual differences in aggression after alcohol consumption, it would be useful to examine these compounds in a larger population, and particularly in a population of alcohol-heightened aggressors.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_37a9256b84790fa043a297939a5b07a4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_468293b60e60ae062b3e2744e4d2dc4a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Race and Criminal History as Determinants of Sympathy toward Exonerated Persons</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.150.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Young, Keli A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e9ddab0a0f8f7d86d1f29563f9becb28">Research has shown that people choose to believe information in spite of it being proved inaccurate and that inadmissible evidence in criminal trials has a harsher effect on Black defendants than White defendants. Similarly, it has been found that White men with criminal records have more employment opportunities than Black men without criminal records. This study is a 2x2 (Race: Black or White x Criminal History: Criminal History and No Criminal History) between-subject design which sought to expand on research already conducted by exploring the interaction between race and criminal history on sympathy felt toward exonerated persons. The participants were undergraduate students ranging in age from 18-22 and randomly assigned to conditions. I hypothesized that participants placed in the group where the exoneree was Black with a criminal history would have the least amount of sympathy, while those in the group where the exoneree was White without a criminal history would have the greatest amount of sympathy. Furthermore, I hypothesized that both White conditions would have higher sympathy levels than both Black conditions. One of the significant findings showed that a criminal record led to lower scores of moral outrage as well as the defendant being seen as more to blame for the wrongful conviction and more likely to commit a crime in the future.  Overall, the results highlighted the impacts of race and criminal history on levels of sympathy as well as the need for more research to be done on the subject.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2e47d3c58d04a88c7dd18aff19e9b802"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_c8939f87bccb9dd5e65fde2aea830dae" level="item"><did><unittitle>3a-hydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one: Alcohol Consumption and Anxiety in GABAA a2 knock-in C57Bl/6 Mice</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.151.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gunner, Georgia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e1e5e9bea48ea232586170e84efb04eb">Allopregnanolone has demonstrated anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties via a GABAergic mechanism of action similar to that of benzodiazepines. Intermittent exposure to ethanol has produced high levels of alcohol consumption in the C57Bl/6 mice strain (Hwa et al., 2011). Withdrawal from alcohol produces anxiogenic effects in many species. A possible synergist action for ethanol and the endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone may exist at the GABAA receptor. Male and female mutant C57Bl/6 GABAA ��2 knock-in allopregnanolone insensitive mutants were subjected to the intermittent access protocol for eight weeks and then analyzed for severity of alcohol withdrawal using the Handling Induced Convulsion (HIC) score (Goldstein, 1972). Animals were tested for anxiety-like behaviors during ethanol withdrawal in the open field and social preference tests after injections of 5.0 mg/kg and 10.0 mg/kg allopregnanolone and 0.56 mg/kg midazolam. There were no main effects for increased anxiolytic behaviors across genotypes post allopregnanolone and midazolam injection; however main effects for sex and ethanol withdrawal were discovered. Male animals and ethanol na��ve animals displayed less anxiety-like behaviors in the social preference and open field tests, regardless of drug treatment. This study suggests that ethanol and allopregnanolone behavioral effects are mediated through a similar neural pathway that is likely to be related to action at the GABA-A receptor.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c70c33f168f503927fd62ba186e20f87"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_15e4e336aa01fcf762eea5d83a6df51f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Action familiarity and the abstract representations of object-directed actions in the human brain: demonstrated with magnetoancephalography</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.152.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Krylova, Margarita V.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_626936d086157cb89d144a7edc75f933">Action representation in the human brain has been localized to the Action Observation Network (AON). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to study temporal modulation in seven regions of interest (ROI) per hemisphere, located within the AON, during viewing of realistic videos depicting familiar and less familiar goal-directed activities. A significant difference in activation was found in four out of the fourteen ROIs tested: the left dorsal premotor area (dPM), the left anterior intra-parietal sulcus (aIPS), the left ventral premotor area (vPM) and the middle intra-parietal sulcus (mIPS). Significantly greater activation for the familiar category was detected from 650 ms to 850 ms in the vPM, and in the mIPS and the aIPS from 1100 ms to 1300 ms. The dPM showed significantly enhanced activation for the unfamiliar category from 350 ms to 550 ms. These results provide evidence that familiarity with a given action results in an enhanced mirror neuron (MN) response during its observation in brain regions located lower in the action understanding hierarchy. The temporal modulation of activity observed in our study provides evidence that action observation involves both the spatial and temporal recruitment of areas within the AON.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fefb146057c6144554e9bede4696ee33"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Psychology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9ccd2d3d7d7af1df9ec746fa5e0675ac" level="item"><did><unittitle>Bilingual and Monolingual Infants' Recognition of Words Spoken in Foreign Accents</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.153.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dillon, Brendan R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_24b3c9699ca3dbe39f7c0d238ac6d03a">Lexical acquisition is one of the most challenging tasks human infants face. Once they are able to separate and identify word forms from fluent speech and map those words onto their meanings, infants must also decipher how much perceptual change in speech is indicative of a phonetic and thus potential meaning change. The current study investigated the effect of foreign accents on recognition of familiar words in bilingual and monolingual 16 to 24-month-olds. Infants were presented with a pair of visual stimuli and asked to find one of them by a word spoken in either a familiar American English accent or a foreign Mandarin Chinese or Mexican Spanish accent. Successful performance on the task was indicated by a significantly greater persistence to the target picture if initially fixated when the word was said in comparison to persistence to the nontarget picture if initially fixated when the word was said. Within the monolingual group, infants displayed a strong understanding of the target words spoken in all three of the tested accents. Exposure to a foreign accent did not provide any additional benefit to later recognition of words spoken in that accent. Furthermore, age and word production both affected performance on the task, such that both older and more advanced talkers displayed stronger performance. Finally, bilingual infants also demonstrated a clear understanding of the target words, as measured through the persistence difference to the target versus nontarget pictures. As in the monolingual group, the bilingual infants understood all three accents equally well. However, there was some suggestion that the bilinguals showed weaker performance on the task overall. In summary, the early word learning infants in this study demonstrated the remarkable ability to understand words spoken in both familiar and foreign accents, even without previous exposure.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b3ab3113a1c098e71af97689cd586dba"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Psychology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_85ec95cf5cf3cac84c9b83ace6adc95a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of Neonatal Testosterone on Intermittent Access Ethanol Consumption in Female C57BL/6J Mice.</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.154.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Geada, Alexandra Maria-Pilar</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_96a736d3620dc5b92ae4664548a8b75b">Sex differences in alcohol consumption are known to occur in human and mouse models. Female C57BL/6J mice consume more alcohol during intermittent access schedules than males, a difference that may be influenced by gonadal hormones. To evaluate the influence of organizational effects of these hormones, a neonatal injection of testosterone was administered within 24 hours of birth. Females that were given these hormonal injections were found to drink less than control females injected with the sesame oil, the vehicle. This indicates a possible organizational effect of testosterone on alcohol drinking patterns. The interaction of alcohol and ovarian hormones was also examined by comparing estrous cyclicity in alcohol drinking and water drinking female C57BL/6J mice. There was no difference in alcohol consumption between stages of the estrous cycle. However, ethanol drinking was shown to alter normal cyclicity, with females spending more time in the diestrus stage compared to proestrus and estrus stages. Future investigations into the organizational effects of testosterone using neonatal castration or androgen blockers could yield more insight into this phenomenon.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0fc7dee336331f98592d7e6d2708e4e9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Psychology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f723e8bb13b3f98c39cdaec86ed02b26" level="item"><did><unittitle>Prejudices of the Selection Process: The Interaction of Attractiveness, Phenotype, and Qualifications in Women</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.155.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stone, Samantha R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1c9643e3979a34a7f5c194f39528473f">Previous research has found that unattractive and black individuals are discriminated against in the job selection process.

Experiment 1 aimed to investigate, within the Tufts University undergraduate population (N = 67), the interaction between racial phenotype and attractiveness. Experiment 2 explored, in a more general sample (N = 188), the interaction between racial phenotype, attractiveness, and level of qualification. Consistent with hypotheses, analyses revealed significant interactions for both studies; however the results were not in the predicted directions.

The control chord (with a low pitch not predicted by any model) was ranked as significantly more dissonant than the other three chords by participants, and the subharmonic predictions were ranked as significantly less dissonant than the harmonic predictions. These results suggest that both the harmonic series and the subharmonic series play a role in consonance perception, with the subharmonic series possibly playing a greater role.

In real world settings, non-spatial information is also involved when perceiving spatial environments. I sought to examine how a social component, information about racial categories, would interact with this proven heuristic during route planning. I hypothesized that the use of racial information would take precedence over other heuristic processes that operate during route planning, leading participants to select routes containing predominantly White residents more often than those containing Black residents, regardless of the direction of the route. Critically, I did not find a southern route bias when modifying the paradigm. However, I did find a bias on east/west dilemma trials: Participants chose western-going routes at an above-chance rate, as compared to eastern-going routes. Further, participants had a better memory for Black faces as compared to White faces, contrary to other-race effects.

While some studies have already suggested that increasing and decreasing one's responses to emotional information are more effortful goals than the passive viewing of emotional information, these studies have not looked across multiple regulation and valence conditions, failing to reflect the variety of emotional situations we face in daily life. In the present study, pupil diameter was measured as an index of cognitive demand as 63 undergraduate students increased, decreased, and maintained their emotional response towards pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. We hypothesized that (1) increasing and decreasing one's emotional response would result in significantly greater pupil dilation than passive viewing, and (2) increasing one's emotional response would result in greater pupil dilation than decreasing. Although the hypotheses were not supported by the data, the analysis showed that the maintain instruction elicited greater pupil dilation than the decrease instruction during the instruction portion of the trial.  This result might suggest that cognitive reappraisal, if anything, is less cognitively demanding than passively viewing emotional stimuli. More likely, however, is that this result is due to a limitation of the study design.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_067e75c5e0f1cd379462320cde722c5b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Psychology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_383ce92f016e48177597db779833be83" level="item"><did><unittitle>Cognitive and Hippocampal Abnormalities in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.159.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tu, Tiffany O.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3ad2b7a28f91d635a556d44871300b2d">Objective: To determine whether cognitive and hippocampal abnormalities found in PTSD are familial vulnerability factors or acquired characteristics.

We used magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and fluorodeoxyglucose-18 to examine hippocampal morphology, resting regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, and activation during a recognition memory task. Results: We found that PTSD twin pairs showed impaired initial encoding during a declarative verbal memory task compared to Control twin pairs. PTSD symptom severity in combat-exposed twins correlated negatively with verbal declarative memory performance in unexposed co-twins. We found no significant abnormalities in visuospatial copying ability, verbal fluency, or hippocampal structure or function.

In a randomized within-subjects design, 46 undergraduates completed this dot-probe task. Attentional bias was indexed using response time. In addition, physiological measures including corrugator activity, electrodermal activity, and heart rate were recorded to index threat-related responding. Participants also completed the external motivation to respond without prejudice (EM) scale to test whether EM moderates attentional bias to dark versus light skin tone. Contrary to predictions, this study suggested that the long presentation of various Black faces did not elicit any attentional bias or threat responses among individuals regardless of their EM. There was, however, a trend of high-EM individuals associated with avoiding dark-skinned Black faces. The null findings of attentional bias and threat response to the conditions may suggest that skin tone variation may not be a strong cue to elicit attentional bias.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_13bcb7f245eb686fdddeb2e53edfc9bb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Psychology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_12e70adaf6239ecfba843286c0351f6c" level="item"><did><unittitle>The role of the NMDA receptor in mediating aggression during withdrawal from ethanol in outbred male mice</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.161.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tayeh, Jillian Katherine</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4e964aa52ff6fabf7e0d899daeac7716">Ethanol withdrawal syndrome, characterized by glutamatergic hyperexcitability in the brain, is a defining characteristic of alcohol dependence. Glutamate hyperexcitability and an upregulation of NMDA receptors have been observed in the brains of mice in withdrawal from ethanol. The present study examined the effects of the uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist memantine on aggression during withdrawal from ethanol. Outbred Carworth Farm Webster (CFW) male mice were given intermittent, 2-bottle choice access to 20% w/v ethanol and water and aggression during withdrawal periods was assessed after 1-2 and 4-5 weeks of exposure to ethanol.  After 16 days of exposure to ethanol, mice drank ethanol in a large range from 25-300 grams/kilogram (g/kg) of body weight.  Handling-induced convulsions (HIC) scores were assessed at the end of the 4-5 week testing session to determine withdrawal severity.  Neither ethanol-drinking mice nor water-drinking mice reached median HIC scores above 0.  During the 1-2 and 4-5 week aggression assessments, memantine was injected (0, 3, 5, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 8 hours into withdrawal.  Memantine did not appear to significantly increase aggression in ethanol-drinking mice but increased aggression in the water-drinking mice at varying doses.  For many aggressive behaviors ethanol-drinking and water-drinking mice has significantly different baseline behaviors.  These findings suggest that withdrawal appeared to have a depressive affect on aggression in ethanol-drinking mice particularly after 4-5 weeks exposure to ethanol perhaps due to a decrease in extracellular glutamate.  Future studies should use microdialysis to determine glutamate levels in the brain in both the withdrawal period as well as during drinking in order to determine if withdrawal or exposure to ethanol is having lasting effects on aggression.   It would also be a good idea to use an NMDA receptor agonist to further probe aggressive behavior and see if aggression can be heightened in ethanol-drinking mice after 1-2 and 4-5 week exposure to ethanol.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9bee915f8b03c68bbb1d753367ba68ff"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Psychology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a8b6eaf32553ed5020fd069db0393e6c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Video Games and Visuo-Spatial Problem Solving</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.162.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Richard, Michael Marr</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_dae57d09e83113689dccd581856c52b8">In 2000, Hodgson and his colleagues used eye-tracking measures to determine patterns in how participants solved visual puzzles. When analyzing the results of this study, Hodgson et al. found a reliable pattern in attention allocation for users, which predicted their efficiency in solving the puzzle.  The study used the eye-gaze data to classify participants into efficient planners and error makers based on their allocation of attention. Independent of this problem solving research, studies have investigated the effects of video game play on cognitive performance.  Research has demonstrated that playing video games decreases reaction time in many situations (Dye 2009), decreases the time needed for spatial visualization (Okagaki &amp; Frensch 1994), and improves spatial attention allocation (Chisholm et al. 2010).  The project presented here bridges these two lines of research.  We hypothesized that expert video game players will represent and solve visuo-spatial problems more efficiently than novice video game players.  Specifically we hypothesized that this would occur on account of either: augmented visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM) capacity; or enhanced perceptual/attentional mechanism.  Our results demonstrated that video game players did indeed perform better than non-game players.  These results were best accounted for by an augmentation of VSWM, rather than enhancements perceptual or attentive processes.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6c9a43c66453e82a363743105fedc68f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Psychology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_64f966280bd329f1cf80ff2168a8db07" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effects of Associative Priming on Retroactive Interference</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.163.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Carroll, William W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cc67f51c286ea9a0a7878de83af8b37c">We depend on our memory for events to inform the decisions we make in the moment.  Whether you are trying to remember the name attached to a face you have only just meant, or trying to give crucial evidence to police about the events of a crime you witnessed, being able to remember the information is only part of it, this information needs to be accurate as well.  Unfortunately, it has been consistently shown that newly learned material can cause people to forget events, or to provide inaccurate information when trying to recall an event in a phenomenon referred to as retroactive interference.  This study seeks to shed light upon the mechanisms responsible for retroactive interference by associatively priming participants towards either the originally learned or newly learned information.  A series of two experiments consistently showed that priming towards originally learned information prior to recall increased participants' recall accuracy.  However, no effects were found when participants were primed towards newly learned', (interfering), information.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b9f42c2a51f69047f6c50f6771cea08a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Psychology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9369055145bc5e07f8a9e827f9edb67e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of social defeat stress on the dopaminergic system, behavioral coping, and cocaine self-administration in male mice</unittitle><unitid>UA005.006.164.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Doyle, Michelle R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9d93c2e5cf00237dbc4e06157085babc">Psychiatric disorders, such as depression and other mood disorders, have a high comorbidity with drug use disorders.

Previous studies with digital animated models have indicated that pigeons are able to discriminate on the basis of action categories. In this experiment, two pigeons were trained to discriminate between video clips depicting different categories of pigeon behavior. In a go/no-go procedure, pigeons responded to video clips of conspecifics
                                walking or courting in the motion condition, or random static frames from the same videos in the static condition. Stimuli were conditionally reinforced so that walking was positive and courtship was negative in the motion condition, with reversed assignments in the static condition. The purpose of the conditional reinforcement was to analyze the relative importance of motion cues based on the difference in performance on the two conditions. Both pigeons learned
                                the dynamic discrimination faster and more accurately than the static discrimination. Transfer tests were conducted to further explore which cues were important in the discrimination of the videos. One pigeon demonstrated partial transfer of the motion discrimination to new videos of each behavior. Both pigeons demonstrated strong transfer to videos played in reverse and to videos with randomized frame order, and no transfer to blurred videos. These results
                                indicate that the pigeons did not use motion cues in the discrimination, and that having multiple frames in the dynamic condition but only a single frame in the static condition may have caused them to discriminate videos better than images. These results imply that pigeons discriminate actions in recorded videos in a different manner than actions of digital models.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_136533dd3a4c0b14b1600069e4ccb900"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The current study pharmacologically tested the role of corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 receptors (CRF-R1) in ethanol drinking following social defeat stress. Adult, male CFW mice were exposed to either 15 (moderate) or 30 (severe) attack bites for 10 consecutive days using the resident/intruder paradigm. Ten days after the
                                final social defeat, mice were tested for the expression of locomotor sensitization following a 2 g/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) ethanol challenge. Daily, voluntary 20% ethanol and water intake was measured during a 3 week period of continuous access to two bottle free choice. Doses of a CRF-R1 antagonist, CP-376,395 (10, 17, and 30 mg/kg, i.p.), were administered, and ethanol and water drinking were recorded 2, 4, and 24hrs after drug administration for stressed and
                                non-stressed mice. We found that mice that experienced the severe stress, but not the moderate, during social defeat stress period consumed more ethanol than non-stressed controls. CP-376,395 decreased ethanol intake of the high ethanol drinkers in a dose-dependent manner during the initial 2 hours compared to the low ethanol drinkers; after 4 hours the drug effect was only observed at the highest dose. This pattern suggests that more intense and longer social
                                stressors escalate ethanol consumption, but not lower intensity and shorter duration stressors. Previous exposure to ethanol access results in a delayed stress-induced escalation of ethanol drinking. CRF-R1 may play a critical role in mediating stress-induced ethanol consumption. Ongoing studies using an operant conditioning procedure suggest that socially defeated CFW mice have increased motivation for alcohol. It is anticipated that lower HPA axis activation and
                                limbic CRF and dopamine will differentiate the stress mechanisms that engender escalated alcohol consumption.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cf3295335bdfd1af1a37050b5ab61193"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

This paper provides a framework for music listening addiction (MLA) as a neurological, physiological, and behavioral affliction similar to recognized substance and behavioral addiction disorders. A comparative analysis of the neurochemistries of addiction and music listening indicates areas
                                of overlap. These shared neurochemical activations should theoretically manifest themselves in similar behavioral symptoms. However, a standardized method of quantifying MLA behavioral symptoms does not yet exist. The Music Listening Addiction Symptoms Test (MLAST), a questionnaire utilizing a self-report method of testing, was distributed amongst a sample population. The MLAST found evidence for the presence of MLA within the population, but it proved to be a
                                poor means of analyzing the effects of MLA. Nevertheless, MLA seems to pose little danger to the individual while music is accessible. Alternative studies of music listening are proposed, and the implications of MLA for the individual and for society are discussed. With few inherently harmful effects, MLA may be viewed as a positive addiction. However, while it is not indicative of risky behavior in most situations, MLA can be significantly harmful and destructive
                                and must be taken seriously. Further neurological and behavioral research is necessary for the continued development of the MLA framework.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_41bee49abf814836f4afe0b650233b42"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The purpose of the study was to investigate how long-term musical training affects visual and aural perception. This study was an expansion of the work by Patston, Corballis, Hogg, and Tippett, which found that musicians were more accurate on a line bisection task than non-musicians (2006). Twenty musicians and 20 non-musicians performed the same line bisection task with both
                                hands, an audiospatial bisection task, and a pitch bisection task. We hypothesized that the musicians would be more accurate than the non-musicians on all three tasks. The results indicate that the musicians were not significantly better than non-musicians on the line bisection task, failing to replicate the previous research. However, an interaction was found between participant group and hand used. Musicians were about equally accurate with both hands, but
                                non-musicians were more accurate with their right hands than with their left hands. Musicians and non-musicians were not significantly different on the audiospatial bisection task. Musicians were significantly more accurate than non-musicians on the pitch bisection task. More hours spent practicing per week, more years playing an instrument, and having relative pitch all correlated to smaller errors in the pitch bisection task. This suggests that musical training
                                aids in processing pitch intervals. Future studies may examine if the Western musical scale influenced the musicians" responses.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_13bf320422d37f400cf4d9532fff0921"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

For instance, people with higher levels of anxiety perform worse on attention-demanding tasks than healthy individuals, and these differences are also reflected in activated regions of the brain. The Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) theory divides attentional (also known as cognitive) control into two categories, proactive and reactive control. Research has shown that anxiety is
                                associated more with reactive control than proactive control. Another line of research has shown that, using a validated set of instructions, people can be trained to use a specific cognitive control strategy. Reasoning that using reactive control might actually promote anxiety, the current study investigated whether training participants to use proactive control instead would have an anxiolytic effect. In the study, participants completed either a proactive or
                                reactive cognitive training (random assignment) followed by a stress task, all while physiological measures (heart rate, skin conductance) along with self-report data on anxiety were collected. Results indicated that the proactive group exhibited marginally lower heart rate than the reactive group in response to social stress, suggesting a lower level of anxiety for the proactive group. Analysis of the skin conductance and self-report data showed no effect of the
                                manipulation. Overall, it appears that cognitive control training may have an anxiolytic effect, but follow up research with more power is needed to amplify any marginally significant effects.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c623e64021b228608c89f718311e03c0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Neighborhood density has been found to predict vowel dispersion; however, results have shown opposing effects. According to Munson and Solomon (2004), words with a higher neighborhood density are spoken with more vowel dispersion, while words with a lower neighborhood density will have more centralized vowels. However, Gahl, Yao, and Johnson (2012) found a correlation in the opposite direction. We predicted that the difference could be explained by the tasks used in each study. Munson and Solomon (2004) had participants read words, while Gahl et al. (2012) examined spontaneous speech using a corpus of natural, previously recorded speech. In the present study, participants were placed in two groups. Each group completed either an oral reading or picture naming task, in which participants were shown either all words or all pictures and read or named the items one
                by one into a microphone. Formants from the recorded speech were then analyzed to determine vowel space. Main effects were found for neighborhood density and frequency, and there was an interaction between neighborhood density and frequency. Group was not significant in either main effect or interaction; however, a 3-way interaction between the three variables was present but not significant. We conclude that task was not a determining variable in the difference between the two prior studies. New evidence released during the time of writing suggests other factors that may be a cause.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The present study aims to examine age and pubertal changes in cognitive appraisal biases on a social-evaluative task in youth with SAD. In this single-session exposure study, youth with SAD and non-anxious controls (aged 8 to 14) were compared on various self-report measures of anxiety. They also rated their perception of performance after giving a speech before and after receiving positive feedback. Additionally, an observational coding system was developed to assess valence and content of children's utterances during a cognitive restructuring task. Results showed that age and pubertal status were significant negative predictors of self-ratings on speech performance
                both pre-feedback and post-feedback. However, age and pubertal stage were not significant predictors of negative performance cognitions, but they were significant positive predictors of the total number of cognitions related to performance. The current findings suggest that there are developmental effects on cognitive appraisal biases in youth with SAD, such that older children with SAD have more negative biases when evaluating their performance on a social evaluative task post-feedback. Additionally, cognitive components of treatment may want to focus more on rationalizing and generalizing exposures with younger children instead of restructuring and modifying cognitive biases given that younger children with SAD did not exhibit the same cognitive appraisal biases as older children with SAD.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Different theories have been used to describe the processes that result in the suffering of the individual's performance. The stress of the situation results in an alteration of the cognitive process that consequently leads to a worsening of the performance. There have been studies looking at how power posing can help relieve stress from high pressure situation and thus improve performance. This study focuses on how power posing can affect performance on high pressure math tasks and whether power posing mitigates the effects of choking. Even though the results of this study were not significant, they suggest a positive relation between high power poses and performance. These statistically insignificant results can be a stepping stone for future research, which can help shed more light on how to reduce the negative effects that
                pressure often has on performance.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Past studies show that it is not uncommon for jurors to have preconceived biases (and they often mask these biases with casuistry), and that jurors put a great amount of weight on eyewitness testimony. Jurors also place a high amount of credibility on police officers, even though it has been shown that police officers are often just as fallible as civilians. However, these beliefs may also vary depending on the juror and his or her ethnic group. An experiment was run on 89 students from Tufts University to determine if jurors are more likely to find a defendant guilty when a police officer testifies for the prosecution (and a civilian testifies for the defense) and if a more explicit juror reminder can be given to mitigate any
                preconceived biases toward or against police officers. Four groups of participants read the summary of a mock trial, which varied depending on the status of one witness and the type of reminder given to the jury. Results did not reach statistical significance, although promising trends did arise, suggesting that a more explicit reminder increases the likelihood that a juror will find a defendant guilty, and the status of one witness (and its interaction with a reminder to the jury) can affect the perception of other witnesses, as seen through ratings of persuasion. Future directions are discussed, and strongly recommended, in hopes of the observed trends reaching statistical significance.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

However, the origin of these biological abnormalities has not yet been identified. Objective: To determine whether psychophysiological and functional brain abnormalities in the mPFC, specifically the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), seen in individuals with PTSD during script-driven imagery (SDI) are familial vulnerability factors, due to trauma exposure, or acquired characteristics of the disorder. Method: Participants were male trauma-exposed individuals with PTSD (ExP+, n=11) and their trauma-unexposed identical co-twins (UxP+, n=11) as well as trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD (ExP-, n=13) and their trauma-unexposed co-twins (UxP-, n=13). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and SDI to
                study blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes during the recollection and imagery of stressful versus neutral autobiographical scripts. Results: No significant differences were found between groups for skin conductance response to stressful imagery versus neutral imagery. Voxelwise analyses of the fMRI data, however, revealed significant differences between the PTSD and Control twin pairs in the rACC for the stressful imagery versus neutral imagery contrast. Specifically, this main effect of Diagnosis represented greater BOLD decreases in the PTSD group during stressful imagery relative to neutral imagery and appeared to be largely driven by deactivation in ExP+ participants to stressful imagery relative to baseline. Conclusions: Diminished rACC activation observed in individuals with PTSD appears to represent neither a familial vulnerability factor for PTSD nor a characteristic of trauma exposure, but instead is likely to be an acquired trait of the disorder
                itself.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Visuospatial working memory has been shown to decline as we age, but could be enhanced by the emotionality of to-be-remembered information. Spatial organization has also been shown to aid location memory. The current study examined how these factors differentially affect visual working memory, spatial working memory, and binding. Participants were recruited online via Amazon Mechanical Turk and then split into three different age groups (younger, middle, and older adults). Participants were shown a series of grids containing objects in specific locations. They were then asked about the identity of objects within the grid, the location of objects, or a combination of these features. We found that, consistent with previous research, spatial organization aided memory for the location of objects. We also found
                that participants were more likely to rely on gist memory when the tested on the identity of negative objects. Finally, we found that emotional arousal helped facilitate the binding of visual and spatial features, but only when the information was presented in a spatially organized configuration.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Mill's plan for a more contemplative and deliberative society. He felt that people were too concerned with intellectual passivity and that society was over-confident in its current truths. One part of my thesis focused on an experiment I developed and administered which tested the effects of teaching students the theory of motivated reasoning. This theory predicts that, when interpreting new information, most people will do so in a biased manner. Most people are more concerned with maintaining their prior beliefs than with incorporating potentially useful but disparate evidence into their opinions. I believed teaching people the theory would make them less likely to interpret information biasedly. My results confirmed my hypothesis: those subjects who learned motivated reasoning were less likely to project their biases while asked to interpret a scholarly article. Though I was pleased with my results, I was more concerned with understanding motivated reasoning in the context of political theory. By studying Plato, J.S. Mill, and Friedrich Nietzsche I came to the conclusion that motivated reasoning supports the idea, best represented by Plato and Nietzsche, that it is impossible to ever reach truth through purely rational means. Instead, it is necessary to supplement reason with some extra-rational force such as desire.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_96d630c5c849ba72e0d472aac74b18f0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Political Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_28675e3f5dbfb0deee56543997c99cbc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Breaking and Bending Originalism: Scalia v.

Yet despite this common citing of history, both justices consistently reach opposite conclusions, conservative and liberal respectively, on the outcomes of religion clause cases. This Thesis examines the originalist approach of both justices and determines what accounts for their differences. While Scalia relies on text and tradition to discover original meaning, Souter looks to more theoretical evidence from the Founders with a broader scope of evidence. This Thesis argues that while Scalia sets a high standard of originalist analysis for himself, Souter's more detailed approach most fully comports with Scalia's theoretical understanding of what originalism entails.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_adce6e7c1c390afdcaadb6ee94442cbd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Political Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e57d80a908d19b37190d60530a2282e6" level="item"><did><unittitle>Determining Factors for Success in Women's Movements: A five-country approach to testing social movement theories</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.035.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Snow, Jessica L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_fb408bd8ec3220f5881349fb79b65138" label="Books [39090015513514b]" type="box">Volume 35</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_db36b5c0a0640ee398da65c946591dd9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Political Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4531c3abaf964e8da5eea61032ccb40e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Obstacles to Liberty: Religion and Commerce in Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.036.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Teytelbaum, Olivia H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9b5aaa2b0f60b1905f0882aba5c25d01">Stressing the vulnerability of Christianity to those 'invitations [which] are stronger than penalties,' Montesquieu proposes the allure of the comfortable, commercial life as a solution to the problems caused by Christianity.

This remains an opinion with constantly high support among Americans.  Nonetheless, Americans still seem to support the violation of individual rights by supporting torture. The priority of civil liberties is embedded in both our Constitution and our governmental institutions. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the correlation between racism and public support for the use of torture and other violations of civil liberties against potential enemies following terrorist attacks or in times of War.  I will address three questions relating to racism, punitive attitudes, and tolerance. Utilizing answers from these previous questions, I will address my final question: how does racism affect the willingness of Americans to sanction the use of torture and other civil liberties violations against suspected terrorists of Arab or Middle-Eastern descent?</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7e1e77f8e3347c932ca90f06a1334b39"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Political Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e3ce13d74555e61ba2defa355c7adeb2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Gender Quotas, Autocracy, and the Status Quo: Explaining Why Morocco has had a More Positive Quota Experience than Jordan or Egypt</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.038.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Powers, Elizabeth K.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_41c1d3a6a82a81081951bd3da0a60372">The Arab world has the lowest percentage of female political participation. While the global average of women in parliament is just over 18%, the Arab region's average is only 9.5%. Certainly many Arab countries resemble each other in their long histories of patriarchy and authoritarian regime tendencies, and these similarities often prevent women's active participation in politics. However, one cannot claim that all Arab countries have identical experiences with gender quotas. Arab countries differ in their quota experiences, but few comparative studies have been conducted. In my research, I study the quota experiences of Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco.  I discuss arguments that have been made as to why women should hold parliamentary office, why quotas are necessary, and how these arguments relate to Arab countries. While not enough time has passed to determine whether or not quotas in these countries are successful or if they empower women, I argue that as yet Morocco has had a more positive experience with gender quotas than either Jordan or Egypt. This may be explained by discrepancies between the countries' political institutions, including electoral systems, the autonomy of the women's movement and by the attitudes of the regimes toward gender quotas. Quotas have succeeded to a greater extent in Morocco than in the other two countries due to each of these factors, most importantly the regime's support for quotas. The strong Moroccan women's movement builds off of this support, or perhaps permissiveness, to give quotas a greater significance and impact than is found in the other cases. Quotas themselves are not capable of closing gender gaps and empowering women, but when applied in ideal circumstances they can bolster efforts to improve the status of women.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8d1044fe68ca7ea1e7c4bf18dff13120"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Political Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f45ad64d434c70bb10ad53e662241f4a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Justifying Libertarian Rights</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.039.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dietz, Alexander S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b056c7e70d989d275c16a7d974f41b94">In this paper, I attempt to discover whether there is a strong intellectual justification for supposing that individuals possess the set of moral rights that many libertarians claim that they possess.

While many researchers acknowledge that individual actors play an important role in shaping these outcomes, the lack of a tool to quantitatively measure this impact means that many studies have skimmed over a potentially important causal factor. The concept of charisma as articulated by German Sociologist Max Weber is an almost mystical personal quality that allows leaders to motivate followers to pursue important goals. In political science, few studies have sought to apply charisma as an independent variable for regulating political outcomes, especially in an electoral context. In contrast, researchers in the field of administrative science have used questionnaires to study charisma in business and organizational settings. My thesis bridges this gap by applying quantitative survey methods to measure the electoral impact of individual leaders' charisma. Video clips of successful gubernatorial candidates from 2006 and 2008 were shown to 142 undergraduate students at Tufts University. Students then responded to a questionnaire rating each governor's charisma. Results showed that governors rated more highly in charisma tended to attract higher proportions of political contributions than governors with lower charisma scores. These findings suggest that candidate charisma may be an important factor in electoral fortune and fund-raising success. However, more research is needed to substantiate this relationship and establish the use of questionnaire measures of charisma for explaining political outcomes in an electoral context.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3a90ddeeea94b2aff709205d0c12e9e9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Political Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9256f92f0c82b194540f7412001e46b8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Political Dimensions of 9/11 Narratives In Secondary School History Textbooks Worldwide</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.041.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Herman, Elizabeth Danielle</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f28d4cc6a509b8681200f2a08caad914">This work examines emerging representations of September 11th, 2001 in secondary school history textbooks of a number of nations worldwide. I hypothesize that narratives of past events are shaped by current political agendas. Subsequently, I identify nine relevant variables measuring various political characteristics, and hypothesize how each variable influences a specific aspect of 9/11 narratives in history textbooks. By comparing and contrasting the narratives in American textbooks with those of nations considered strategically important to U.S. foreign policy, I aim to identify if these narratives converge or diverge, and whether they propagate what is accepted as 'truthful' or 'mythical' representations of event. In a thorough review of the literature on narrative construction in textbooks, I examine how textbook narratives reflect current political characteristics of nations, as well as how accounts are manipulated in order to influence national memory. The omission or inclusion of certain events, the emphasis on specific actions, and the words and tenses chosen to convey messages and themes are all important elements of understanding the broader messages that a nation attempts to convey, as well as the identity constructed, intentionally or not, from these hegemonic and official narratives.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7b3828eeccced25b94c7048827c6c6b4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Political Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e084a9437f724bfaf2bd7e7b7de866f2" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Comparative Study of Democratization in Cameroon and Tanzania</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.042.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Berlin, Erica P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0f238652caf33339637fe3d77a3add76">In the late 1980s, countries across Africa began moving from authoritarianism to democratization. Many observers believed this would lead to a promising future and greater political transparency. Yet, after 1993, the political regimes in many of these countries began rehardening. As a result, many states now have hybrid regimes that have aspects of both authoritarianism and democracy. Cameroon and Tanzania experienced this exact pattern. However, in the past few years, Tanzania has been making progress towards democratizing, yet Cameroon has remained stagnant. This work examines why Tanzania has democratized in recent years, yet Cameroon has remained competitive authoritarian. I use three elections as case studies: Cameroon's 1992 presidential election, its first multiparty presidential election, Cameroon's 2004 presidential election, its most recent presidential election and Tanzania's 2000 presidential election, its first election to be considered largely free and fair.

The Constitution acknowledges this right to property in the "takings clause" of the Fifth Amendment, placing a limit on the burden that a single landowner may carry for the benefit of the public. The Supreme Court, however, has failed to provide a precise legal definition of a "taking" and to establish the limits of government regulation, issuing instead vague and often contradictory decisions over the last 100 years.  This thesis approaches takings cases with two aims: primarily, to describe the history of the Court's handling of regulatory takings cases, following the evolution of its test-based approach, to explain its takings doctrine to the extent possible. Concurrent with this effort is the highlighting of the main inconsistencies between landmark rulings. As a second goal, I tackle finding an explanation for those inconsistences, looking beyond legal analysis to introduce extralegal factors, particularly the Court's consideration of a ruling's future impact, as an influence during deliberations.  While the Court's Constitutionally prescribed duty is to examine nothing other than the precise legal question before it, there is widespread acceptance that outside influence affects Court decisions. I include impact consideration in these extralegal factors, particularly in the context of takings cases, and show the role that reference to impact plays in those decisions, both in speculating on the ruling's practical execution for the parties involved, and in anticipating the legal impact of the decision on future cases.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_df4e95271022c2bf5d06e82e9d5ea148"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Eminent domain</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_535b126057e229a30390c408a1e46ed5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Machiavelli and The Federalist</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.044.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hawley, Michael C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cfdc2edbef01f43bf38bba5901083df9">The Federalist Papers are considered by many to be the most revealing guide to the thought underpinning the United States Constitution. Written chiefly by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton (with a small contribution by John Jay) under the pseudonym of Publius, The Federalist advocated for the ratification of the new Constitution. Niccolò Machiavelli was a Renaissance republican thinker, whose insights into politics in The Prince and Discourses on Livy profoundly shaped subsequent political thought. Despite the fact that the American founding constitutes a seminal moment in the history of republicanism, few scholars have sought to use the thought of the great Florentine republican to enlighten us about it.  This thesis explores the complicated relationship between Alexander Hamilton and James Madison as expressed in The Federalist through the interpretive prism of Machiavelli. Although joined temporarily in a united front to secure the ratification of the new Constitution, Madison and Hamilton would go on to become bitter political enemies. This thesis argues that the latent tensions between the Virginian and the New Yorker can be discerned even in The Federalist. Using Machiavelli's thought as a guide, the thesis tracks a dialogue between Madison and Hamilton across four themes: human nature, the proper character of the American republic, issues of restraint and empowerment, and republican virtue. Ultimately, the views of Madison and Hamilton achieve an imperfect synthesis in The Federalist, a partial reconciliation that can be better understood through the thought of Machiavelli.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0df54bc9a3d5f4e07b9b40f222e2d90a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Federalist</subject><subject source="local">History</subject><persname source="local">Machiaveli, Nicholas</persname><persname source="local">Hamilton, Alexander, 1757-1804</persname><persname source="local">Madison, James, 1751-1836</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cc5e9d32af9920a51cfa0a6b78bb8e9b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Anti-Immigrant Outrage Language in Anglo and Hispanic Media</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.045.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Miller, Sara Anne</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2df36be4bb89271142b2269c0c44099a">Anti-immigrant outrage language in the media dealing with Hispanics in the United States illustrates the larger consequences of political pundits and the effects of various media sources, as well as the difference in coverage of these issues between the English- and Spanish-language media. Professors Sarah Sobieraj and Jeffrey Berry define outrage language as a type of political incivility that is dramatic and aimed to, _��provoke a visceral response from the audience, usually in the form of anger, fear, or moral righteousness through the use of overgeneralizations, sensationalism, misleading or patently inaccurate information, ad hominem attacks, and partial truths about opponents,_�� (Sobieraj, Berry, p. 2).	This type of discourse is commonly seen within the infotainment industry, a hybrid of news and entertainment, which frequently uses outrage tactics to boost ratings. I look specifically at the effects of this industry and these individuals on the Hispanic population and how the Anglo and Hispanic media portray these incidents differently. 
\
	Because the Hispanic population is quickly growing from a minority to a majority in the United States and will eventually be a large proportion of the voting electorate, it is necessary to look at how our political atmosphere treats them. In answering the question of how Anglo and Hispanic media cover the issue of immigrants and immigration, specifically dealing with Hispanics, I will conduct a content analysis of English- and Spanish-language newspaper coverage of these issues.

It is the most beautiful educational treatise every written._�� Rousseau and Plato demonstrate in their writings the importance of education in society and in the life of the individual. This thesis explores the role of education in Emile and the Republic and looks into the similarities and differences between the two thinkers. One of the strongest similarities is that both Plato and Rousseau claim that men live in chains and education can be the means to deal with them. While Rousseau attempts to legitimize the chains of society, Plato discusses the quest to break them. Based on this connection, my thesis analyzes the meaning, purpose, methods, and principles of education in each book. Rousseau and Plato attempt to build strong characters as the foundation to cultivate the intellect. They value the cultivation of comparative thinking and the contribution of education in the formation of citizens.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9d24a7aa4282bd9341fc2b702f693362"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_e13fb360e704ec25ca2a9061903db9d2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effectuating Political Change Through Election Formatting:  A Study of the Top Two Primary System</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.047.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bendetson, Michael Novick</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6d87a5513cb28aa62d238689277ed684">In an attempt to curb the polarization of national politics, several states have adopted the new top two primary system to select their federal representatives and senators. The electoral format permits all voters the opportunity to participate in one  primary with all the candidates listed on a single ballot irrespective of party. The two candidates that receive the most votes are the _��top two_�� and advance to the general election regardless if they are of the same political affiliation. Based on the widening of the nomination process and the potential disregard for party in a general election, reformers believed this system would be more apt in producing elected officials that  reflect the moderate ideology of the median constituent voter.  
\

\
This thesis tests the aforementioned assumption on a number of levels. First, I utilize a quantitative statistical analysis to observe the ideological differences between  elected officials and their citizen electorate in areas of top two systems and in areas of non-top two systems. Secondly, I establish four case studies to both examine the effects of the top two primary and conjecture on the reform_�_s hypothetical impact on elections operating under the older primary systems. Lastly, I quantitatively examine the impact of  the top two system on voter turnout to measure if the primary format is creating greater voter interest in elections. The study concludes by noting while voter participation  increased under the top two system, the reform failed to consistently establish a closer political alignment between citizens and representatives.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cc975d10ae9056756de1a8fa017a1083"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_6706d9066c472d82286be3b1ff2345d3" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Tea Party in Congress: Ideology and Compromise</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.048.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rosenblum, Daniel H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_868648283df40b60c0d81399dbbb57ac">This paper investigates the common portrayal of Tea Party-affiliated members of Congress as uncompromising ideologues. It brings to bear qualitative and quantitative techniques on six different case studies of Congressional votes in addition to broader statistical analysis. Results show that Tea Party Caucus membership is often strongly associated with uncompromising, counter-establishment Congressional voting behavior. However, endorsement by a national Tea Party organization tends not have this same effect. As a group, the _��Tea Party freshmen_�� mostly blend with the rest of the Republican Party_��except for their votes on the debt-ceiling controversy.

This thesis seeks to analyze and lay out the intricacies of the sector with a specific intent to examine the operations of Privatized Military Firms (PMFs) from an economic perspective. Employment of PMFs by United States governmental agencies often overlooks the incentives shaping firm choices, resulting in potentially higher net costs to taxpayers than if the functions in question had not been outsourced. I begin with a brief overview of privatized warfare, establishing a typology within which to frame subsequent inquiries. Then, I explore the lack of competitiveness present in today_�_s PMF contracting process, before turning to the dynamism, and subsequent inefficiencies, resulting from a project-based, asset-light PMF corporate structure. Finally, I investigate the failure of U.S. governmental agencies to take into account transaction-cost economics when conducting cost-benefit analyses comparing a PMF employee to their public counterpart. I argue that incorporation of economic drivers into the conversation surrounding the privatized military industry could shape regulation of the field in the future, ensuring that the government can better outsource security in both an efficient and effective manner.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cf52b2f224873f8d0db8684a3abf8e9c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_8b31dc228cd87f3c535573f89aa50c2a" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Empowerment of Indigenous Women: Traditional Knowledge, Sustainable Development and the Role of Culture</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.050.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Burton, Dana I.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_199fcfb0efa18e9595b852367ccd3806">Women of indigenous tribes all around the world have valuable information about the environment.  However, in many cases, they lack the power to share that knowledge, even within their own village.  The main research question of the thesis is: what is the connection between the knowledge that indigenous women possess about traditional agricultural practices and the effect of their empowerment on the augmentation of sustainable development practices in agriculture?  The clearest example of the significance of the role of indigenous women is in Ecuador.  Ecuador is one of the most diverse biological and ecological regions of the world.  Concerns about population growth and limited natural resources are causing uproar among the international community.  Moreover, there is conflict over the control and use of those resources.  The opinions between indigenous peoples, the government and the international community vary greatly; and these perspectives have much to learn from each other in order to reach a sustainable system.  Therefore, this thesis will contribute to the cross-cultural awareness and understanding between the different stakeholders in Ecuador and in the world.  The hypothesis is that the practice and preservation of traditional knowledge is contingent upon indigenous women; as they become more empowered in their community, the role and importance of traditional knowledge as a method to promote sustainability in agricultural will be maintained or increased.

Women tend to be civically involved, rather than politically involved, and come from backgrounds based in education and healthcare.  Men tend to be more politically engaged and come from business and legal backgrounds.  It has also been posited that women_�_s lack of psychological engagement in politics is due to the perception that politics is a _��man_�_s game_��.  Women either perceive themselves as unfit for politics or have little desire to enter into a field dominated by men.  In response to this hypothesis, another was made about the importance of the visibility of women in the political arena; the more women there are visible in politics, the less politics is perceived as a man_�_s game, and the more women will be inclined to engage themselves in politics.  Finally, there has been very little literature on the impacts of women in the legislative process as it relates to all constituents.  It has been demonstrated that women represent women well, but little has been done to explain why women_�_s involvement in the political process serves to benefit everyone.  &#13;
\&#13;
This thesis aims to explore the accuracy of prior scholarship as it relates to New Hampshire politics, as well as provide an answer to the question of why women_�_s participation in government is important for all constituents.  Using statistical analysis of legislator biographies and qualitative interviews with women from New Hampshire, I have discovered that women in NH politics do tend to come from healthcare and education backgrounds; NH women are more involved than men in both civic and political activities prior to election; during childhood and later in life, the visibility of women_�_s public and political involvement is a positive influence on other women_�_s political engagement; the enormity of the New Hampshire legislature and its quasi-volunteer basis creates opportunities for increased female participation; NH women_�_s history of working in the mills may have helped to create a social norm of women working outside of the home; and finally, due to women_�_s alternative style of conducting politics, if a critical mass of women were to be reached in the legislature, the character of the legislative process would be vastly improved.  Through this thesis, we gain a better understanding of the process by which women become involved, how we can use that understanding to put more women into office, and why putting more women into office is important.  &#13;

While D.C. residents accept that these two factors have had a significant presence in the failure to achieve Congressional voting representation, I examine the Congressional Record to identify traces of race and partisanship over time. This study provides both qualitative and quantitative examinations of four periods: the 1960 Twenty-Third Amendment, which granted District residents the right to vote for president; a failed 1978 Constitutional Amendment to grant equal voting rights in Congress; and the 2007 and 2009 District of Columbia Voting Rights Acts, failed measures to provide the District one voting representative in Congress. These four efforts represent four moments when the discussion of District representation made it to the floor of Congress for an extended length of time in the past one hundred years. A textual analysis of the relationship between the poll tax and D.C. suffrage in the debates over the 1960 amendment reveals the level of association between these two racialized topics. A study of the partisan breakdown on the votes on Congressional passage and roll call votes establishes a more quantitative portrait of the increasing influence of political polarization over time. Finally, I borrow from and expand upon the study of implicitly coded racial references and apply this methodology to the Congressional Record from these four periods. Such a novel application of this method to the Congressional discussions on extending the franchise to D.C. finds the small but continual presence of racially-coded words, predominantly from supporters who tied the issue to broader black enfranchisement movements. The findings better situate the District in the context of other national and international suffrage movements.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_acd0f82392504032c700908aaa11fb4e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Political Science</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8a19ad618d3b0729f7a6ee3588240952" level="item"><did><unittitle>Evaluating the Crying Double Standard in American Politics</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.053.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hessekiel, Kira H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7962e5c06bb7e292190834104b6f29c0">Today, many pundits and politicians alike argue that a crying double standard exists in contemporary politics, meaning that tears from men are perceived more positively than those from women.  But is this claim true in the mind of the American voter, and if so, how does the context of the episode come into play?  Through the analysis of data from a political psychology study of Tufts students as well as four case studies of prominent politicians who have publicly shed tears in the past 40 years, this thesis seeks to understand the relationship between, gender, context and voter reaction to crying on the campaign trail.  I divide political tears into two categories, the overly emotional (weeper) and the compassionate.  While my hypotheses predict that female weeper candidates and male compassionate candidates will be rated more highly than their counterparts, my statistical analysis finds that men are actually punished for compassionate tears while women are not, and that weeper are equally disliked, regardless of gender.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c0fa1c96d0010d36b22de43ca8e56f25"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Political Science</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_568caf1843f23634d95d9e0e062f44aa" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Nation of Mothers: Public and Private Applications of Gender and Domesticity in Indonesian Culture and Politics</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.054.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Read, Blair</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d8cf9ce5af1ca55bc7b40ff5ef49fe5c">This thesis examines gender ideology in Indonesian culture and politics, using the domestic realm as a microcosm to study the New Order gender philosophy. Concentrating on the relationship between domesticity and sociopolitical systems, I will provide nuanced insights into gender equality in Indonesian society, placing household patterns of female autonomy within the context of a dichotomous relationship between male and female participation in the private and public realms. Through quantitative analysis, I confirm that there exists a state-dominated gender ideology that creates bifurcated spheres for men and women established through the veneration of womens position within the family. In my analysis, I identify a societal equilibrium in which decision-making responsibility is shared within the home between the husband and the wife, and women perform the lions share of the household work; women are awarded dominance over the domestic realm as a means of limiting their ability to participate in the public arena. Finally, my use of political, economic, sociological and psychological paradigms will allow me to better situate my findings within national and international scholarship on gender equality from a global, multidisciplinary perspective.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1d73e932d0b73cf794a9ab4f5f629708"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Political Science</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4751b1b517621f24b7941676b39bdcd2" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Silent Minority: An Examination of Female Justices of the Supreme Court during Oral Argument</unittitle><unitid>UA005.007.055.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Howe, Caroline H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c28a2a27d70ea5032c090b67c75614a6">My study seeks to recognize and substantiate the value of gender diversity on Supreme Court jurisprudence. Specifically, I explored the impact of female Justices on oral argument, from the behavior and treatment of the Justices to the content of their arguments. Using cases from the first two terms of each of the four female Justices who have served on the Court, I studied both the behavior and treatment of those Justices in order to better understand the
                                dynamics of the Court in which they exist. I then studied the insertion of their perspectives into the oral arguments of gender cases. Much of their behavior on the Court, from the amount that they speak to the number of times they are interrupted, exhibits their confidence and willingness to engage with their colleagues. The presence of many "perspective statements" throughout the broad swath of gender cases I examined also demonstrates that female Justices are
                                unafraid to link their identity with their speech when it comes to gender cases. My study demonstrates that a value does lie in the specific contribution of women to the Court. The white, male lens should not be considered a neutral perspective, but instead one among many perspectives that can contribute to a better understanding of the impact of our laws on the individual rights of our citizenry. The increased representation of women on the Supreme Court, and on
                                every court, will make huge strides towards ensuring the representation of those interests in the laws of our country.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a9ac0531c725eca125d8367409114993"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

These fundamental goods do not mean anything unless people have the political and economic ability to harness them. Cities have historically been seen as the provider of this access for the masses, but white communities have consistently benefited at the expense of communities of color. Further, the lack of equity in access has not been the result of
                                chance but rather conscious choices made by the power brokers who direct urban development. The history of development is one of inequity, but this is not to say that equitable development is impossible. As seen through various case studies in the Boston metro-region, while the past 75 years are strewn with cases of unequal development decisions, recent years have seen a paradigm shift in the language of development to one that emphasizes equity.

Hume argues that government's most essential function is to provide for the safety of its people, but that in order to do so it must first have authority sufficient to secure its own continued existence. Government's authority rests not on force,
                                but on the perceived self-interest and opinions of its people. Factions, which represent rival perceived interests and opinions, threaten government authority, and religious sects are among the most threatening factions of all. While many methods have been advocated to allay the detrimental political effects of religion, such as those of persecution and the institution of a separation of church and state, Hume suggests that only an established church can quell the

This is largely a result of his use of spontaneous order theory. Hayek is clearly adamant in tracing the economic and political origins of that theoretical scaffolding to the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment. In doing so, he places Adam Smith in what he
                                calls an "anti-constructivist" tradition, actively working to dispel notions of rationally designed or mutually agreed-upon orders in the Hobbesian tradition in favor of analysis of spontaneous, unintended ordering forces. By tracing the ways in which Hayek draws upon Smithian thought, even in cases without explicit reference to Smith's ideas as such, I argue that Hayek was justified in his placement of this Scottish moral philosopher and political economist in
                                such a tradition; finding in Hayek's work both a lucid understanding of Smithian ideas as well as effective argumentation for principled extensions of such a framework. Rather than simply appropriating and perverting Smith's ideas through a libertarian bias, as some have argued, I endeavor to show that through his use of Adam Smith's political economy and moral theory, Hayek strengthens and extends the spontaneous order tradition in pursuit of a more rigorous

This thesis examines the intersection of immigration policies and language policies across three key modern time periods: 1986-1987, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In 1986-1987, the Immigration Reform and Control Act and the reauthorization of the Bilingual Education Act were
                                signed. In 2001-2002, the DREAM Act was proposed, President Bush was conducting bilateral immigration talks with Mexican president Vicente Fox, the USA PATRIOT Act was passed, and the No Child Left Behind Act was signed. In 2005-2006, the Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act and the Inhofe Amendment to the act. This study codifies the rhetoric and framing of immigration and language policies in two major national newspapers, the New York Times
                                and the Wall Street Journal. The study establishes a new research design to examine how national printed media framed immigrants in articles covering immigration and language policy with either "universal" or "particular" claims. It applies this framework to test for similarities and differences in the characterization of immigrants in these articles and how that might affect the subsequent discourse. The study concludes that the two policy areas did not have
                                rhetorical strategies that correlated over the three time periods due to the differences in the level of sophistication and nuance in the discourse. This analysis is a substantial expansion on the historical narrative of bilingual education policies.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e4de7a93f484adeff6664d137ce1f0fe"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In 2012, two in three Americans said they would elect him today if given the option. Realistically, though, if a candidate had a history of a mental illness, would he or she be able to gain his or her party's nomination? Given the structure of the primary process and popular attitudes about mental illness, I argue that it would be difficult for a
                                candidate with a history of depression to gain the nomination. If the leader to whom we compare so many candidates might not be able to survive the modern primary process, perhaps we should question whether we truly assess our options in a responsible and informed way.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_236a0d789b1511fe69455b16d595d8ef"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Focusing on the trends in preferences, behaviors, and lifestyles of young and middle-aged unmarried women as compared to other demographic groups, I offer insight into how marital status, age, and gender impact an individual's political identity. Through quantitative analysis, I confirm that each of these factors age, gender, and marital status deeply impact an individual's party identification, policy preferences, and political participation. I also identify the importance of the lifestyle changes of women beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s related to older median age of marriage, higher first-birth rates for women over 35, and increased labor force participation of mothers. Finally, I argue that, due to these lifestyle changes, it will be increasingly important to finely study the factors that
                impact young and middle-aged women's preferences to reach one of the fastest-growing voting blocs in the nation.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The two authors were divided by centuries, socio-political position, language, and political landscapes. This difference is essential in understanding their works, as Frederick's work serves as an adaptation of Machiavelli's thoughts and ideas on military-political theory, developing Machiavelli's ideas for a later time and a different socio-political system in Europe. Frederick's work is a masterful piece of deception, as he uses the title of his work and several introductory arguments to create the false idea that he disagrees with Machiavelli. Instead, Frederick actually agrees with Machiavelli's ideas, assenting to these designs by converting Machiavellian ideas into ideas that make sense in modern times. Fredericks seems to write in such a deceptive way for a variety of reasons; perhaps he is attempting to deceive other monarchs, leaving
                them adrift amidst a sea of lies. At the same time, Frederick may also be attempting to lay out his true military and political intentions to future generations or potential allies. This work has analyzed the developments of these authors in three key areas: fortune and deception, the makeup of military forces, and just warfare and the general benefit of warfare.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

While case studies regarding commissions were conducted in the 1970s, they were almost entirely qualitative studies that focused on a few select commissions of interest. These studies also exclusively examined commission legislation that had previously passed into law. Alternatively, this thesis focuses on proposed congressional commissions, with a larger sample size and quantitative analysis as part of its research design. The time period from which the data were collected included the years surrounding 9/11; from 1999-2003. The sample of 457 proposed commissions provides insight into the general landscape of the commissions proposed in Congress, along with information about various attributes of the members that sponsored the bills. Additionally, proposed congressional commissions were examined by the event that inspired their creation, such as 9/11, the Columbine
                shooting, and Bush v. Gore, to gain a better sense of how commissions are used by Congress in reaction to an event. This study concludes that congressional commissions proposed in relation to an event were used and presented differently than those that were unrelated to an event. Moreover, congressional commissions proposed in relation to 9/11 exhibited significant differences in terms of the types and proportion of commissions passed compared to other event commissions. This analysis presents new information on what commissions were proposed from the 106th to 108th Congress, who proposed them, and the relevance of events to commission legislation.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In order to expand educational opportunities for students in D.C., policymakers on the local and federal level have implemented two school choice programs in the district: charter schools and vouchers. This paper evaluates the oversight practices of these two programs by comparing information from the regulatory organizations themselves and reports from the Government Accountability Office. I will argue that the lack of uniform standards and the failure to enforce stated regulations in the voucher program have created a financially and ethically irresponsible program that must be reformed. Furthermore, the differences in the regulation and oversight of participating voucher schools as compared to charter schools and traditional public schools represent an unsubstantiated faith in the superior quality of private education that must be reevaluated.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_08e6732d2b4ea4e64127a7826ec38b84"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in American Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8fef23054e1dbb3dca0d758ec4898462" level="item"><did><unittitle>Participation, Power, and Place: Roots of the Community Health Center Movement</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.047.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sobelson, Morissa</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c83dfad75af16d27be1badc92be5429c">The Tufts-Delta Health Center, established in the Mississippi Delta in 1965, was the forerunner of a movement that changed the way we think about health and health care. It furthered national awareness of the failure of traditional health systems to reach marginalized populations, and showed the effectiveness of bridging public health and clinical interventions at a grassroots level. It demonstrated why race, class, and power are important determinants of health, and why community is a critical locus for health care delivery and social change. The project not only managed to initiate an empowerment-based and comprehensive approach to health care, but it did so in the context of some of the most entrenched race, class, and status segregation in the country. Through analysis of the stories and archives of health and civil rights pioneers, this thesis examines the participatory approach they took to promoting health and community empowerment at one of the nation???s first health centers in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. I use an empowerment domains framework in order to understand the application of this participatory model, sources and impacts of opposition to the center, and the ways in which these dynamics can inform contemporary health equity and reform efforts.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f3165e6dbdf4775a42cddd4e1c2b287f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in American Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7f807c6eaa6dbd9b033cb4a757e7b0f6" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Role of Urban Agriculture in Environmental and Social Sustainability: Case Study of Boston, Massachusetts</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.048.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gittleman, Mara</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8252adb9216000ad2ec9c7cb2bb0df17">Due to the modern-day abundances of processed and prepared foods in grocery stores and fast food restaurants, we are far removed from where our food comes from. This is inflicting enormous tolls on our climate, public health, and environment. Twenty percent of the fossil fuel used in the United States goes toward food production, and while the U.S. produces a surplus of food annually, over 35.5 million people in the country are food insecure (Pirog 2005). Community gardens work to mitigate many of those disparities by increasing access to nutritious fresh produce. Boston has had a tumultuous history of food distribution and local food production, and a study of how that is still manifested in the spatial distributions of community gardens and affordable, fresh groceries would show how successful Boston has been at overcoming its food gap. For this study, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software was used to map community gardens, supermarkets, small and specialty grocery stores, and convenience stores within the context of local demographics to identify any areas of Boston that can be classified as food insecure. Data from this was used to analyze significant disparities in access to food between racial and socioeconomic demographics with several remarkable and grim results, including that the top 25% communities most vulnerable to food insecurity have more community gardens than convenience stores, showing a distinct response to a lack of affordable, healthy food.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b783b5a35b15bdac0b52b65cc12e2a71"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in American Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_383138e0f0d801acf116aead18f51729" level="item"><did><unittitle>'Live and Direct:' the Impact of Live Nation on Contemporary Popular Music Performanceab</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.049.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Goralnik, Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4c4b9dfe58241b06905fa34d7732d857">The Reagan administration initiated an era of sweeping media deregulation that culminated in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, considered by many to be the most important piece of media policy in US history. In the wake of this broad agenda, a handful of large corporate entities, the largest being California-based Live Nation, have come to directly own most of this country's live music promotional apparatuses. While the existing literature on media deregulation and consolidation does not sufficiently address live popular music, the field's dominating frameworks would suggest that by corporatizing and commodifying a media product, deregulation would have a decidedly negative impact on popular music performance. My research, the first that deals entirely with contemporary popular music performance, refutes that suggestion. Based on interviews with popular music performers on their experiences with Live Nation venues and promoters, my research characterizes the goals that popular musicians associate with their performances and arrives at a surprising consensus: that performers across the popular music spectrum feel that Live Nation does not compromise and actually enhances their ability to achieve their performance goals. My research expands the body of media deregulation theory to include popular performance, and my findings break from the ideologies that dominate the field, suggesting that live music requires a new framework and ultimately a new field of research.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_68b32c7a99b6c9cd66bbbd398741a4a7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in American Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f3f59fbd918cdba3ccd434084d52c275" level="item"><did><unittitle>'Thanks to DI my child can read': Direct Instruction and the pathologization of Black students</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.050.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Halle-Erby, Kyle M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_882a99e78d9c24ff27803a463abfafd9">Developed in the 1960s by Siegfried Engelmann, a White man without a background in education, Direct Instruction (DI) is a curriculum developed through mostly Black test groups and currently used in elementary and middle schools nationwide. Students in DI classrooms repeat small, skill-determined tasks that eventually make up larger concepts in math and reading. Teachers in DI classrooms read from scripted lesson plans, based on Engelmann's work from the 1960s, and the classroom is carefully regimented. Students, even in kindergarten, typically sit in individual desks, their posture is monitored and there is little variety among the materials available for the students. Drawing on the history of White-led educational initiatives of the Freedmen's Bureau and the freedmen's aid societies during the Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction eras, I use Critical Race Theory to examine how these reforms pathologized Black people, establishing their race and culture as the source of their hardship. Using the theories of colorblindness (Gotanda, 1991; Haney Lopez, 2007), interest convergence (Bell, 1980) and Whiteness as property (Harris, 1993) I investigate how Direct Instruction follows the pattern of White-led reforms that pathologize Black students, thereby producing White supremacy.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_93272bd7059e1b66661c68efbbde0a1d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in American Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e7f8f4f93c0332a42fe927a5c53bb269" level="item"><did><unittitle>Bilingual Education and the English-only Movement: A Critical Race Theory Perspective</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.051.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Zhang, Lily</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8aa06d85773bafd9d0001d3dd8bc47a9">Debates surrounding bilingual education, race, and the English-only movement are once again taking center stage with the passage of California's Proposition 227, Arizona's Proposition 203 and Massachusetts Question 2 - all of which virtually outlaw the use of an English language learner's primary language in the classroom in favor of a structured English immersion (SEI) model. Collectively known as the Unz Initiatives, this movement towards English-only is changing the shape of bilingual education in the U.S.  This study is both a critique of the history of bilingual education policy and an ethnography of the complex relationships among language, race, and knowledge in one SEI classroom. I utilize a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, specifically applying the concepts of Whiteness as property (Harris), critiquing Colorblindness (Gotanda), and interest convergence (Bell). Based on ethnographic data gathered through classroom observations and interviews with students and teachers, I argue that language is tied to race and thus policy regarding language is in fact race-conscious.

Using economic anthropological theories of the "embeddedness" of economy within social and cultural settings, I posit that these restaurants serve as multifaceted institutions of economic incorporation, promoters of multiple cultural identities, and centers of geographical and virtual communities.  In addition, Somerville's Latino immigrant-owned restaurants exist within a system of neighborhoods changing due to gentrification, transportation, and demographic changes that influences their capacities for growth, change, and survival.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2a443538b23c3febe49f3005a1136af0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Hispanic American business enterprises</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4f687304ff4fd2c6e64ceb99631979ee" level="item"><did><unittitle>No one wins.

However, those tests are just one piece of the broader push for school standardization, which has been not only ineffective but has also exacerbated existing social inequalities in its one-size-fits-all approach. My thesis uses existing research to examine how the push for "higher standards" and more accountability in schools has, in fact, resulted in diminished learning, unfair expectations for students and teachers, and a disproportional burden on students of Color. I then use examples from the television series The Wire to illustrate the ways in which standards-based reform methods are producing and reproducing social inequality. Although it is a fictionalized representation, The Wire, with its narrative freedoms, is perhaps more capable than a non-fiction work of depicting the myriad ways in which school standardization results in unbalanced power dynamics and restricts student engagement. Ultimately, through the research and the depictions in The Wire, I conclude that standards-based reform is a strategy that aligns with the American ideal of school as "the great equalizer," but actually serves to heighten the role of schools in the creation of racial, socioeconomic, and other societal inequities.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_513b02377da7e5ed4c5a0ccc75ad10ec"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Educational accountability</subject><subject source="local">Academic achievement</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_be65e00751bb0868929280f8bf0781ba" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Note So High Nobody Can Reach It: White Supremacy, Citizenship, and Massachusetts' Question 2</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.054.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Spooner, Emily J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_47a050d08b68c898dbb7b6f4181c6fb2">This paper examines the ways in which larger constructions of citizenship enter into debates about schooling. Specifically, it argues that citizenship transcends its traditional legal definition, and that full citizenship includes the ability to meaningfully participate in American social and legal institutions. This definition of full citizenship, however, has been unevenly distributed on the basis of race, and has therefore led to a conflation of whiteness with citizenship that continues to have pervasive implications for educational policy. This paper uses Massachusetts' Question 2, a 2002 ballot question that mandated English immersion for English language learners (ELLs), as a lens through which to view issues of citizenship and the racial and linguistic construction of Latinos in the United States. In examining Question 2 and the debates surrounding it, this paper suggests that this ballot initiative did not exist in isolation, but entered into a growing racialized anti-immigrant, particularly anti-Latino, sentiment. As a result, this paper uses critical race theory to examine these debates and argues that ultimately, Question 2 and the arguments surrounding it demonstrated a commitment to white supremacy and a failure to recognize the racialized nature of instruction for ELL students.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c6606689be6a7bb4de786a9793c62805"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">English language</subject><subject source="local">Race</subject><subject source="local">Citizenship</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6010d4b470d1543c7f1495fd3fcc0495" level="item"><did><unittitle>Trash Talk: Coded Racial Narratives in Sports</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.055.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jr., Jose A.

A unique dynamic is created when a population of African American athletes is described, represented, and judged by a body of American sportswriters that is over ninety percent white. The language that is often used to describe those athletes is often riddled with coded racial narrative that suggests that Blacks are inferior. Often times, African athletes who commit crimes or engage in troublesome behavior are looked at as unruly children who are products of damaged, unstable, environments. This sort of rhetoric ties in with the stereotyping of people, families, and communities of color. It is important to point and critique sports media for portraying negative stereotypes because of how misinformed, damaging, and destructive these portrayals are. By analyzing the cases of Barry Bonds, Tiger Woods, and Dez Bryant I illustrate how sportswriters can use sports to produce covertly racist material. In this thesis I discuss how sports media as an institution of power promotes social inequality. In each of the cases I use a critical race theory base to demonstrate how coded racial narrative found in news articles, sports blogs, and books allows for racialized commentary. I find that the portrayal of African American athletes by sportswriters damages not only the reputation of those athletes but also perpetuates stereotypes of African Americans, does tangible damage to the careers of the affected athletes, creates an environment where covert racism is acceptable, and serves as another form of institutional racism.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2eae6cce769dfceadaf8434724b41137"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Race</subject><subject source="local">Sports</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bc346fda3f989285109d82ba73cf537b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Working to Learn: The Effect of Vocational Education on Working Class Student Engagement</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.056.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gray, Julie Ann</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_67b2cbfda86a4d3a32ab529acc1e4b79">Increasingly, districts are phasing out vocational education programs as the emphasis on standardized testing and measurable academic skills becomes stronger. Yet, these programs often fill an educational void for working class students, teaching them a specific, applicable skill set and locating their culture and knowledge within the institution of the school. This study explores how vocational education programs positively impact working class students' engagement. To investigate this claim, I collected qualitative data consisting of a five-month period of classroom observations and interviews with teachers and students in the drafting and machine technology shops in the Somerville High School Center for Career and Technical Education. Drawing upon pedagogical theories of student engagement of sociological theories of cultural capital and reproduction, this investigation demonstrates that because vocational education programs cater to working class youth in a way that traditional academic programs do not, they has a positive impact on working class student engagement. Pedagogically, vocational classrooms utilize the classroom-business model, authentic assessment, and active, independent student learning to provide students with applicable skill sets and tie abstract academic concepts to the real world. Sociologically, vocational education programs recognize the importance and value of working class cultural capital while simultaneously teaching students aspects of the dominant cultural capital that they need in order to advance socially and economically.  Finally, vocational education programs provide a physical space within the school in which working class culture and capital is promoted, protected, and appreciated.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_651ba1b5c48cba249aa65c0c87e8b0b7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Vocational education</subject><subject source="local">Working class</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0b1db381fb571c1699d309960e77fb8c" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Role of the Public Health Insurance Option in the Health Care Reform Debate of 2009-2010</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.057.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kohnstamm, Paul W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8ad5697b28dbcee4d794c62a3f73cd9b">A successful legislative strategy for passing a comprehensive health care reform bill had eluded American presidents for generations. Each reform effort had its own unique challenges, and the conventional wisdom among observers is that the public option debate was yet another obstacle that President Barack Obama had to overcome in his quest for health care reform. The public option is a proposal to create a government-run insurance plan to compete with private health insurers. While the public option did pose certain challenges to achieving health reform – such as creating an ideological gulf between liberals and conservatives and driving moderates away from the negotiating table – I argue that the policy had a net positive effect on the effort to pass the most comprehensive health care bill possible. The public option was able to be negotiated away for significant policy achievements that arguably impact more Americans than the public option that was ultimately debated by Congress. Further, the public option was used as a bargaining chip with stakeholders to negotiate for the financing of health reform and crucial political support for the bill. Lastly, the public option was a popular policy proposal that acted as a lightning rod in absorbing conservative attacks that would have otherwise been directed at less popular – yet more essential – provisions of the bill, such as the individual mandate. In this sense, the public option preserved comprehensive health care reform, and the basic structure of the Affordable Care Act.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9f35f8597e0c9bbbca9609131bd9c84f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Health care reform</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_52c46261dfab2f2cc73f89918a3d0500" level="item"><did><unittitle>Small Schools in a Big System: A Study of the Revival of the Small-schools Movement in New York City Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel Klein</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.058.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Salamon-Abrams, Roxie</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_088e7ae4c66228c25b45734af093eaac">This thesis examines the development of the small-schools movement from its origin as an alternative education approach to its contemporary place in education policy in New York City. I argue that many of the core values and ideals of the small school model were lost when Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel Klein's Department of Education implemented a reform plan that rapidly created hundreds of new small schools over a short period of time. Using original interviews and research of speeches, articles, books, policy agendas and critiques and evaluations of small schools in New York City, I aim to better understand how the small school model came to be at the center of Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Klein's plan for a bold transformation of the largest public school system in the nation. I will analyze the small school model from both the perspective of early small school educators and the perspective of policymakers in New York City to demonstrate how rapid scaling up of the small school model may, in fact, undermine its ideals.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a63ff4ff82e4ef7f448a76df803fb472"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Small schools</subject><subject source="local">Education, Urban</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0781990daf4a7713e51e5e8f3f7756e7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Exploring Progressive and Race-Conscious": An investigation into White Tufts University students' awareness of issues of race and racism</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.059.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chatillon-Reed, Anna H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b5057130e20ac8c14ac05a5dbc6a2d97">This study investigates how White Tufts University students demonstrate awareness of issues of race and racism, an awareness that is prerequisite to (but by no means a guarantee of) further engagement with issues of race, racism, and White supremacy, and meaningful anti-racist thought and action. This awareness is manifested in three ways: using a vocabulary that opposes the dominant definitions about race and racism, engaging race and racial power as societally relevant, and acknowledging that all White people are implicated in the co-construction of White supremacy. There is little published research regarding how White undergraduate students are aware of, challenge, or interrupt White supremacy and racism; this study was conducted to help fill this gap. The data used in this analysis were collected through qualitative open-ended interviews with White undergraduate students in a variety of majors, and I utilize Critical Race Theory to frame an analysis of the resulting data themes. The data indicate that White Tufts students are more likely to demonstrate awareness of issues of race and racism if they have taken academic courses about structural inequalities based on gender or race.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a1b0640e4700478d45ffcd8fa6e2a156"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_af3bd8fcf6c2edc9e19efaeb8cc18ba6" level="item"><did><unittitle>How the West was Played: Offering Indigenous Voice to Video Game Studies</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.060.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jackson, Crystal R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6b230a6929d1419ba3334b79a71ca6cf">While many scholars have addressed the presence of stereotypical representations of Native Americans in the traditional media of film and literature, there has not as of yet been much dialogue around the newer medium of video games. This is in part due to their newness, as well as a perceptual gap in the colonial imagination between technology and Nativeness. This study offers close readings of moments in two recent video games, Red Dead Redemption and Gun from the location of a Native and white scholar invested in gaming and gaming culture. This work serves as an episodic look into the nuanced representations of _��Indian_�� characters in these game spaces, as well as how the peculiar component of gaming--the interactive mechanics of game play itself, serve at times to reinforce dominant discourses found within the game_�_s narratives, but that also offer moments of subversive potential. This look into two mainstream games finds both repetitions of controlling images and elements of more complex, nuanced images of _��Indianness,_�� as well as moments in which _��Indianness_�� is mobilized to shore up white colonial projects of violent imperialism. The last section of this paper focuses on the possibilities of re-appropriating these images from a Native playing position, as well as gestures towards Native game developers creating virtual content outside of these mainstream avenues, in such a way as to provide a space for Native gamers to play from less contested subjective positions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6e762836fdaf68bcc0596fa877000cc2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_7571709fdbc691d4145970230dcff471" level="item"><did><unittitle>Raced, But Not A Race: A Perspective of Latino Racial Identity</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.061.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pequeno, Justin J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7d9e9d8a25cd9bca708c882e75d350c9">Latinos have become the largest minority group in the United States and their identity has become of great interest to politicians and educators alike.

Today_�_s field of genetic medicine is rooted in the social and scientific movement of twentieth century eugenics and began with the mass screening of newborns for Phenylketonuria (PKU). Using screening for PKU, a disease most prevalent in populations of Northern European descent, as a framework for genetic screening is problematic. First, it continues a eugenic preferencing of treating diseases of white populations and of purging mental disability. Also, the public health program for PKU screening is flaws in two distinct ways: it does not include informed consent and thus violates civil rights of individuals, and it does not have sufficient evaluation and support which have led to pitfalls such as maternal PKU. By using the PKU screening program as a precedent for expanded genetic screening, we are perpetuating these injustices and leaving eugenic thought in the field of genetic medicine unexamined.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5679d5bd64ca0270f9f322299c7a66dd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_f7b5413973d19f0006cc2359846ed338" level="item"><did><unittitle>School Choice: A Case Study on the Boston Public Schools</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.063.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hirsch, Cleo L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_693c24e91668b2fe83624b6a9afc5893">This paper makes a detail-oriented, historically based assessment of the school choice policies for high school students in the Boston Public School System (BPS). Because the school choice debate is inseparable from the historical and current realities of the opportunity gap, which is a racially stratified phenomenon, this study focuses on the way in which school choice breaks down across race and effects racial segregation. The central questions this paper seeks to answer are: How does the implementation of school choice in Boston match some of its stated and implicit goals, particularly in relation to race? In practice, is the current district-wide, mandatory choice program a promoter of, or detractor from the city_�_s goal of creating a thriving urban school system that provides equal education opportunity for all students? These questions are answered through an analysis of the history of school choice in the United States and the current national debate on choice, as well as the local history of choice in Boston and the school choice programs used by the Boston Public Schools. Within this case study, a statistical analysis of segregation under the current choice program finds that choice is not creating a more integrated portfolio of high schools in Boston than neighborhood-based assignment would. Furthermore, this study finds that the complexities of the current choice system are creating barriers to equal access and opportunity. Based on the findings of this case study, the paper concludes with relevant policy suggestions for the BPS as they move to reform the school choice processes in the following years, as well as a discussion of the questions that are left to be answered as the BPS moves forward with their school choice program.

This work emphasizes that the return of the dead is socially real, and that this return demands inquiry into the histories of the spaces they occupy. Linger reveals Anglo American and governmental complicity in and demand for the torturous,murderous, and genocidal interactions with African Americans and American Natives that created this nation. This is accomplished by examining haunted Gettysburg as a misconstrued site of salvation of enslaved Africans and African Americans, by following spectral Natives to histories of displacement and murder, and by concluding with the haunting of a Louisiana plantation by black, Native, and white spirits. Linger investigates local and national histories tied to self-proclaimed sites of extreme haunting. These appear on the internet, television, in travel guides, and as profitable facets of the tourism industry. While focusing on the melancholic and troubling subject of trauma, Linger is a hopeful project that endeavors to correct and broaden American history within the Anglo American Dominant Narrative. Linger is an appeal to the reader to approach with a high degree of suspicion any historicism that holds a resolved, not melancholic, relationship to trauma: the dead continue to return in social reality and provide a constructive opportunity to understand our collective positions as inheritors of histories of loss,violence, and murder.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0cf1a105be67174bac511c2fd3bb9c34"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_6e8f7cfec4e72c81485fedf8858e99e1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Just How White is "The Great White Way"?: Racial Narratives, White Audiences and White Supremacy on Broadway</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.065.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Noling, Ann Card</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1c74210e3d0c9b7c67007891997951c0">In response to a critical focus on the representation of people of Color on Broadway, or theatre for people of Color off-Broadway, this thesis examines how Whiteness is constructed and presented to White audiences on Broadway. I identify three different ways race is dealt with in mainstream theatre: 1) shows where race, problematically defined as only about people of Color, is explicitly marked and is obviously central to the story_�_s plot 2) shows where race is not explicitly marked and the casts are all White and 3) shows where race is not explicitly marked and the casts are multi-racial. Using both Critical Race theory and Performance Studies theory as a framework, and focusing on the past five years on Broadway, I look at how shows in each of these categories engage with or inform Whiteness. In each category I identify and analyze common patterns within the category and then do an in-depth case study of one show in each category. The three case studies, corresponding to the categories listed above, are: 1) Memphis by Joe DiPietro and David Bryan 2) God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza and translated by Christopher Hampton and 3) August: Osage County by Tracy Letts. I find that in all three categories, Broadway shows reinforce White supremacy by failing to analyze Whiteness and ask White audience members to recognize and examine their own Whiteness and White privilege.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9226a7bea30c5b639f4940e7c33083e7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_1c5cfe630397e8af14c86fb4d73d7591" level="item"><did><unittitle>School: A Comic Viewbook</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.066.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gregory, Chase P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1d24bd6a717c1a5dd8777874cb12af7e">School is a comic book presented in the form of a Tufts Admissions viewbook.

Over the course of three weeks, I compiled 35 student interviews, then worked with each profiled person in order to design an artistic profile. School, in addition to being a frame for viewing the college experience, is also designed as a critical inquiry into the ethics of representation, specifically with regard to advertising or the so-called _��visual identity_�� of an institution like Tufts. Its use of meta-language, heterogeneous style, and cyclical self-reflection is meant to mirror the kind of critical thinking that is ethically necessary in any kind of storytelling, as well as to draw attention to the impossibilities of any kind of complete or accurate self-representation or representation of others. Ultimately, the project is meant to provide a lens for critiquing institutionalized forms of representation in favor of a more collective, contradictory, and unstable retelling of the college experience.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9b1c0495f5a0ce8c2545716985ae6c1f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_d2fcdd403d4912885a55d82b17b6c82f" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Qualitative Study of Student Health Insurance Policy Change: The Future of the Student Health Insurance Market</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.067.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Markowitz, Daniel J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2ab9523270c8f6ef89ee41ab5cdbe7d3">Health insurance allows individuals to access and afford health care.  However, not all insurance policies are comprehensive, and some can leave covered populations without sufficient protections.  Historically, the student health insurance market has provided students with inadequate coverage.  While a better understanding of the student health insurance market would be valuable, research on this market is largely absent from the literature.  In my thesis, I use available literature on the student health insurance market combined with data from 18 key informant interviews to examine the student health insurance market, and answer the questions, what problems exist within the student health insurance market, and how can the market be improved in light of national health care reform?  My goal was to determine the barriers and facilitators to the adoption of new student health insurance programs.  I explored ways to improve the student health insurance market including primary care, on-site health centers, education, self-insurance, risk pooling, and self-insured consortiums.

Strong economic, political and social ties and the residents' navigation between two national systems and cultures characterize the cities, despite the international border between them. Since 2008, Jurez has been the site of ten- to eleven thousand murders related to clashes between drug cartels and Mexican state forces, becoming internationally infamous as Murder City. While El Paso was not the spatial site of violence, the traumas in Jurez have had profound effects on the lives of El Pasoans. Drawing from interviews with El Pasoan residents, I show that the drug war represents a critical moment in the historical trajectories of the cities. The violence constitutes a further wedge between the cities, fitting into a historical trajectory of increased social and cultural division. I argue that this fracture has led to three main social changes: a) an anxiety among Chicano El Pasoans as their ability to live their Mexican heritage becomes restricted, b) a change in migration patterns from border crossers to people who stay in one country, and c) to increased awareness of the external gaze of Texas and the United States on El Paso.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bb1697a3107f9afd6f8fe14dd9644702"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in American Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ee7b2a7e536e36b96e8234a8083abdea" level="item"><did><unittitle>Relocation to Representation: The Changing Face of Minneapolis City Politics</unittitle><unitid>UA005.008.069.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lillehaug, Kara M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5075cd94637dc48dc288c3c126b77b0a">In 2013, Abdi Warsame was elected to Minneapolis City Council, becoming the highest ranking Somali in the United States and usurping three-time incumbent Robert Lilligren. His election came on the heels of a transformation of the redistricting process in the City of Minneapolis and an endorsement from the largest party in Minneapolis, the Democratic Farmer Labor Party (DFL). This thesis is divided into two parts. The first section reveals and explores the
                                systems of power constructed by white, male,heterosexual interests that are present and operating in Minneapolis city politics. Specifically, I focus on how the influence of powerful special interests in Warsame's election and the lack of multicultural literacy in the Minneapolis DFL almost cost Warsame the DFL endorsement and have potentially altered his decisions after election within City Hall. The second section is focused on how the Somali community, as led
                                by Warsame, was able to overcome these structures of power through their use of innovative grassroots organizing methods. In particular, I center on the new application of the Get Out The Vote method and reliance on alternative media outlets. As such, Warsame's story, although unique, illuminates some of the invisible structures of power present in many cities politics that operate, exclude, and manipulate newcomers and marginalized communities while providing

This thesis explores the political biographies and resistances of three formerly incarcerated men of Color who have survived the
                                criminal injustice system and the systemic violence of prison itself, and despite the odds stacked against them, have become politicized activists, continuing to resist and organize against the dehumanization and oppression of other incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people.

In an age when America's youth are so often accused of apathy, mimicry and complacency, the undocumented youth movement, begun in the early 2000's to fix the country's broken immigration system and change a firmly established national discourse around migration and citizenship, is an important case of
                                powerful youth agency and action. With deportations at all-time high levels, the growing militarization of immigration enforcement and the repeated failure of congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, Americans cannot continue to stand by as families are torn apart. With the aid of an accompanying classroom guide, How Big We Are can be performed and read in middle and high school classrooms to teach students about the contradictory and unjust
                                realities of our country's immigration policy, the ability of youths to make a real difference in their communities and the power of art as an organizing tool. It also raises important questions about the way to present discussions about race, documentation and immigration in the classroom. How Big We Are was created using a set of nine interviews conducted with activists, immigrant youth, politicians and citizens about their experience and views on immigration
                                and immigration reform. The project built around it is an exploration in combining activist theatre and activist pedagogy with the goal of creating a curriculum capable of creating political consciousness in students.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_524bae959c856104912da6105f52cc4a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

" This is what Professor Vernellia Randall, Professor of law at the University of Dayton, wrote about Pres. Clinton's effort for a healthcare reform. Exactly twenty years later, we have Pres. Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The
                                Obama administration promised that the ACA would give the United States a better healthcare system. What can marginalized communities truly expect from the reform? Will the reform rectify health inequities? Or will some communities continue to be served in "healthcare ghettos"? I use a four-component definition of health disparities to answer these questions. Healthcare disparities can be measured by the extent to which a person: has access to affordable care;
                                receives superior quality or inadequate medical care; experiences discrimination; and can trust the care to be accessible and affordable on the long term. Drawing on research in public health, history, traditional economics and legal theory, I analyze the impact of the ACA on each of these measures of healthcare disparity. I conclude that the ACA only truly addresses the first of these four components, the affordability of healthcare. But it does so incompletely.
                                I hope that this research will serve health and social justice activists to better describe their goals and strategize for future reform of the United States" healthcare system.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7c9f88954b311b17783e5781266f3bf3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Board of Education in 1954, one of the biggest issues in U.S. education is the marginalization and failure of students of Color. Through both a film and a complementary analytical paper, this thesis examines Diploma Plus (DP), a predominantly Black and Latino alternative schooling program at Charlestown High School (CHS) in Boston, and how it empowers its students of Color. Through reading about (and actually seeing and hearing) the voices and lived experiences of the students at Diploma Plus and the educators who teach them, we can see that students of Color do not simply choose to drop out of school, and that schools as institutions, if and when they challenge traditional forms of White-centered schooling, can make education a liberating rather than a marginalizing experience for students of Color. In a White supremacist society that already labels students of Color as defiant,
                uncultured, and unteachable, the purpose of this thesis is to challenge these images that relegate students of Color to the margins. In this way, it also deconstructs the dominant narrative that further labels the students of Color that leave school as 'failures' and at sole fault for their decision to leave. Lastly, it raises larger questions about what the purpose of education should be and whether schools, as they are currently structured, can be sites where a student of Color can be truly educated.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The policieshave brought a major increase in national education standards, high-stakes standardized tests,and outcries from many parents and educators across the country. Renaissance, a public middleschool in Montclair, New Jersey, that was founded just before No Child Left Behind was passed,offers a unique perspective on the ways the different policies have affected public schools, and isa school whose founders were dead set against any standardization of education. Throughinterviews with teachers and administrators at the school, as well as an analysis of a communitythat is deeply involved in its public school
                system, I will demonstrate the power and importanceof community engagement in public schooling, and will offer suggestions for improving currentstandards and policies. This thesis aims to elevate the voice of teachers whose opinions havebeen largely ignored in recent debates around policies, and to offer a critique of high-stakestesting as the most effective method of student assessment.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

A more nuanced history of evangelical race relations is thus needed in order to highlight the intersection of race and religion in one of America's most influential Protestant traditions. My project takes on this task by providing an in-depth look at the self-identified black evangelicals of the late 20th century. Their sermons, publications and organizations illuminate the diverse ways in which black Christians contested white norms and grappled with the very term 'evangelical.' Some utilized secular Black Power ideology in the push for a separatist, black theology and worldview, while others advocated for a theology of racial reconciliation that engaged white Christians in an attempt to unite believers as one body of Christ. In uncovering this history, I argue that 'evangelicalism' itself
                is a racialized term in that race dictated the very core of what it meant to be an evangelical Christian in the late 20th century.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

This concern represents a shift from the movement's primary focus in the past, which was centered on exposing oppression in Israel/ Palestine and addressing American complicity in the Israeli occupation. Given the large concentration of White and White-passing people within the movement, I argue this shift is particularly important in that it forces activists to address the many ways they are implicated in oppression far closer to home. I also argue that in the pursuit of joint struggle, the links between the U.S. carceral-security state and the Israeli occupation which I identify in terms of goals/ impact (i.e. the upholding of White supremacy ) and profit _are especially important to highlight.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">United States--Foreign relations--Middle East.</geogname><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Involvement in the arts, especially when introduced during childhood, can positively contribute to these children's lives in a variety of ways, ultimately contributing to the development of high self-esteem. First, participation in the arts can lead to heightened competence in other domains, which may be because the arts allow children to access material in novel ways more suited to their abilities (Wilhelm, 1995). Accessing knowledge in a more comfortable and effective way may help children with reading disabilities develop positive associations with learning, feeling that they as capable as their peers. Second, children with reading disabilities are able to use artistic and creative talents, which may be part of these children's inherent abilities, making it possible for these children to express themselves without being hindered by or reminded of their deficits (Wolff &amp; Lundberg, 2002). Therefore, participation in the visual arts utilizes and underscores talents that may be natural and come easily to these children. As a result, involvement in visual arts can help enhance self-esteem among a population of children who are at particular risk of developing feelings of inferiority and inability (Harter, Whitesell &amp; Junkin, 1998).For these very reasons, an introduction to the visual arts to children with reading disabilities is important during the early school-age period. At a time in which children with reading disabilities first are confronted with their learning differences, the visual arts can uncover and expose the talents that these same children often have, helping them to develop self-esteem that they will carry with them throughout the remainder of their lives. Of course, not every child with a reading disability will become a famous artist; however, this thesis argues that, no matter the scope of ability or talent that the child carries, the visual arts have the potential to change these children's lives for the better.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_36576c563f5b9954bc2d863b31b34b9a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Child Development</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3c441200e01241c3e57aa0b7042c552d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Open Arms Family Center: a grant proposal</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.029.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Woodard, Meaghan E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e5f99260c46f0866bb1b80ea32042a65">A proposal is made for a comprehensive family support center, The Open Arms Family Center, to address homelessness in families with young children.

In an attempt to lessen the potential long-term impact of these early delays, broad-ranging accommodations and supports have been developed and integrated with varying degrees of success. Although there has been some research into the potential benefits of using sign as a supplementary language support, it is extremely limited. This study sought to explore the possible developmental implications of the use of sign with children with special needs who were already using sign as a means of support. Children identified as using sign were observed in both classroom and camp settings, and the contexts, situations and nature of their uses of sign were recorded. In order to obtain a more complete understanding of the nuanced and complex functions of signing within these contexts, many of the students' parents and teachers participated in semi-structured interviews, describing their experiences with sign and the ways in which the use of sign took shape in the classroom or home. The results of these observations and interviews suggest that the use of sign as a supplementary language support has implications for the emotional development and the development of self-regulation in the children taking advantage of these accommodations. Although the incorporation of sign in addition to more typical verbal language supports requires sustained adult effort for its successful integration, this investment seems to help provide a sense of trust and security between the child and caregiver. Trust and security seem to help initiate and promote increased communication, socialization and overall adaptation for these children.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4917b18c0e33f6c006407c60d07362c2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Sign language</subject><subject source="local">Children with disabilities</subject><subject source="local">Child Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_011b08df6391ff3611fbf8edd666fda5" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Educational Trajectories of Latina Teenage Mothers: How Do Certain Stressors and Supports Influence the Ability to Juggle Family Building and Educational Attainment?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.031.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wright, Charlotte Anne</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_dd25711c00c498e0f3286ca8b65e1c7a">Using data from the evaluation of a home-visiting evaluation program, the educational trajectories of first-time Latina mothers under the age of 21 will be examined and interpreted in this study. Why and how some of the Latina teenage mothers in the sample continue with their education while others discontinued will be explored by comparing the circumstances of fifteen young Latina mothers who stayed in school and on track, fifteen mothers whose education was interrupted and then resumed, and fourteen mothers who discontinued their education. An understanding of the common challenges that the Latina teenage mothers in the sample face and the kind of supports that may aid them in staying in school and _��on track_�� is provided in this study through the examination of selected school and family-related stressors. Certain supports and stressors will be examined through a cultural lens in order to learn how the often, clashing cultural scripts of family building and educational attainment are successfully, or not successfully, juggled by participants in the present study. The objective of this study is to better understand the barriers that may challenge the graduation of Latina teenage mothers, and to recommend those supports that might facilitate overcoming of these barriers.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2b8c495833b297d4b787722d2c1eddc2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_5834ca460a9401b6fb54f9ea8da4b7f3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Peace and Justice Education in Theory and Practice</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.032.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lavender, Madeleine</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0be637bae83b410b3d5d70804c57845a">This paper draws on a vast collection of progressive methodologies in the field of education to propose a comprehensive framework through which to consider educational practices that serve the promotion of peace and justice through schooling.  The Peace and Justice Education (PJE) framework represents a value-based model, and aims to promote students_�_ moral, emotional, social and intellectual development, and to graduate students who are dedicated to leaving the world a better place than they found it.  In addition to defining the PJE framework in theoretical terms, this paper describes a study that attempts to discern if and how PJE is translated into practice at three schools with an espoused commitment to aspects of the framework.  Observational research in participating classrooms suggests that a dedication to PJE is in fact translated into observable practice at each school, though the framework is found to be more apparent in some classrooms than others.  Findings also reveal patterns related to aspects of PJE that appear to be emphasized most and least at the each site.  Descriptive _��snapshots_�� of the three classrooms studied offer examples of how three teachers have implemented the framework, and provide a sense of what PJE might look, sound, and feel like in practice.  Finally, the paper offers suggestions for further research on the topic of PJE.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bc2e2fb92a493e486c3e67aefbacd1b2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_22d22bd97534083c16da9fddc172bfa9" level="item"><did><unittitle>But What Does Fido Think?: The Association Between the Presence of a Pet and Maternal use of Mind-Related Language</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.033.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crossman, Molly K.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8697739108621fb0f6a2c767e441e8db">The goal of the present study was to explore the relation between the presence of a companion animal and maternal use of mind-related language, which has been associated with the development of theory of mind and empathy in children. In order to investigate this intersection, a sample of 19 mothers and their children each participated in two, five-minute, filmed free-play interactions, conducted in a laboratory playroom, one of which also included the family dog. The films were then coded for maternal use of mind-related language. Although rates of maternal use of mind-related language did not differ significantly based on whether the dogs were present or absent, mothers did use mind-related language to refer to their dogs. Findings suggest that involvement with a dog, rather than simply the presence of a dog, may be associated with differences in maternal use of mind-related language. The results of this exploratory study point to the need for continued investigation of the relation between interaction with companion animals and maternal use of mind-related language, with particular attention to the possibility of implications for intervention development.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8ae16d55ee19ca513bcb3d235f199636"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Child Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9a689ecb89ff7d2914669d4ea010074c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Breastfeeding and the workplace environment: Does employment affect the rate of breastfeeding in the Black population?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.034.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fleurant, Erin Peabbles</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_32580435edcb7233c0030275fcfe786c">Benefits to breastfeeding range from reducing childhood obesity and infections to decreasing cancer risks in mothers. However, the practice of breastfeeding is not done uniformly across populations in America. Non-Hispanic Black women consistently have the lowest rates of breastfeeding. Barriers to breastfeeding in all populations have been explored in literature and include, among others, race, socioeconomic status and employment. However, specific aspects of employment as a barrier in this population have not been discussed. This research study aimed to explore what specific aspects of employment, if any, influenced the decision to breastfeed among non-Hispanic Black women. Working with the Mattapan Community Health Center, data was collected in two phases from women (n=11) as well as their employers (n=5) using in-person and over-the-phone administered questionnaires. Early findings indicate that while women did not find employment to be the most significant barrier to breastfeeding, they also had little to no knowledge of company policies regarding breastfeeding policies. When speaking with employers, the new legislation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was not mentioned, indicating the possibility that employers are not aware of the Act's effects on working mothers. These findings can guide future efforts towards increasing breastfeeding rates in this population by focusing efforts on educating employees and employers on policies and legislation regarding breastfeeding.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4e5be45cdfdde6b19533a6134b6c6813"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Child Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_616db6012379b52bdaf7abd457a050cf" level="item"><did><unittitle>Documenting Cultural Variations in Culturally Responsive Classrooms</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.035.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Miller, Amanda I.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0503a90dc262db125ca979d5e79f3bb4">Drawing from the support of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy to diminish disparities in academic achievement across students of ethnically and racially diverse background, this study aims to support future empirical research by first documenting if and how cultural variations can be observed.

When it comes to grief work, research shows that college students are understudied and underserved. The goal of the study was to establish prevalence of grief, identify complicating factors that exist in the college setting, and explore support systems and coping methods that this age group utilizes. Through a mixed methods survey, 113 students provided responses based on their experiences with grief while enrolled at a private university in the New England region. Experience was assessed using multiple methods including the participant's responses to open-ended questions; analyses included percentage calculation of response prevalence, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Results show that the prevalence of grief in college is higher than expected. Family and friends are the most commonly used support systems, and being away from home is the hardest part of grieving in college. Finding time to grieve and balancing a hectic schedule were also listed as complicating factors of grieving in college. Suggestions to aid students who are grieving were made, including: (a) establishing school support for traveling home, (b) developing protocols for professors to follow, and (c) restructuring of mental health services involving outreach campaigns and more availability of resources.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_72c94c7a08249a653d1779afc884a5d8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Child Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2c041990b595b407dd847fbb13da8beb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Co-Viewing and the Educational Potential of Touch Screen Technology</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.037.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nicholas, Gabriel M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_afdf07473eac109c2ea2ea6bf9edecd3">This study explored the interactions between preschool children and touch screen technology when they played with a parent versus when they played alone.

Participants were 53 parents of children with autism recruited through Facebook messages. Participants filled out an online survey that asked them to rate their satisfaction with their pediatrician on a number of measures, and to report whether or not they had tried a number of CAM and conventional treatments with their child. 30 parents reported using at least one CAM treatment, while 23 parents reported never using a CAM treatment. Analysis revealed a negative correlation (r= -0.352, p=0.01) between Pediatrician Satisfaction Score (PSS) and number of CAM treatments used. In addition, parents who used CAM reported lower scores on all measures of pediatrician satisfaction than parents who did not, although this group difference was not statistically significant. One interpretation of these results suggests that parents' use of CAM negatively impacts their relationship with their pediatrician. Alternatively, these results could reflect that parents who are less satisfied with their pediatricians are more likely to try CAM. More research is needed to learn more about the population of parents of children with autism who choose CAM. In addition, more resources should be devoted to educating parents about safe, evidence-based treatments for autism, and preparing pediatricians to discuss CAM treatments with parents.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_384a34cef1a1d03ea01ef265e9e12a1a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Child Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1cb65de7f037e653bb37afa5f737c1ae" level="item"><did><unittitle>Early Maltreatment, Executive Functioning, and the Protective Role of Early Childhood Interventions</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.039.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lamoreau, Renee S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_55729f4d04e3ea6bed6a0849f47abcbf"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_106649049d4388496421b83c4de5fcf7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Executive functioning, a subset of cognition associated with the prefrontal cortex, is highly influenced by adverse early experiences like childhood maltreatment. However, since the developing brain is adaptive, social support and therapeutic interventions may alleviate some of the negative effects of maltreatment in young children. This senior thesis examines the effects of maltreatment occurring prior to 24 months of age on preschool-aged children's executive functioning, also exploring how home-visiting and center-based childcare programs may improve cognitive outcomes for at-risk children. Data were drawn from a randomized control trial examining the impacts of a statewide home visiting program for adolescent mothers and their children. Findings showed that maltreated children did not exhibit lower executive functioning when compared with non-maltreated children. These findings provide support for resilience following early maltreatment; or conversely, the
                neurocognitive effects of maltreatment may remain latent until middle childhood or adolescence. Results also indicated that earlier placement in center-based childcare (d24 months) was associated with higher visuo-spatial working memory but other domains of executive functioning were not significantly related to center-based childcare participation. These results indicate that center-based childcare may produce domain-specific executive functioning benefits but more investigation is needed to determine the linkage between center-based childcare and executive functioning."</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study and Human Development.</subject><subject source="local">Executive functions (Neuropsychology)</subject><subject source="local">Child abuse.</subject><subject source="local">Child welfare.</subject><subject source="local">Child care services.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b2f9c6f1c783eb72f46b7ed9fbef2fbd" level="item"><did><unittitle>'Are You a Good Witch, or a Bad Witch?': Female Stereotypes in Animated Television</unittitle><unitid>UA005.009.040.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Frank, Deborah S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ed2de91db474aacf0708c2937617663b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7dcf25ce932a79e285c088fa28ec23d4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This content analysis examined a total of thirty episodes of ten different cartoons. A team of undergraduate and graduate students coded all speaking characters for demographic information, physical portrayals, and a variety of personality traits. Results of this particular study found that males outnumbered female characters about two to one. Females were rated as skinnier and more beautiful, and were more likely to be kind and less likely to be cruel than males. With a discussion of these findings, the research team hopes to add to the literature discussed and provide useful information for caregivers and educators about children's media content. The results of this study indicate that there has been improvement in the content of children's animation but that there is still very much a need for more diverse, multidimensional characters. Further media effects research is also an important and necessary addition to this study and existing research to better
                understand how children are affected by the images presented to them on television.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject

PDNF binds to the NGF receptor TrkA and promotes the survival and differentiation of neuronal cells, as well as entry into the cell by T. cruzi. A screen for T. cruzi proteins that mimic other neurotrophic factors was performed, and a T. cruzi mimic of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was identified by its binding to the GDNF family of ligands (GFL) receptors GFRalpha-1, 2, and 3. GDNF, like NGF, is a neurotrophic factor involved in neural cell growth and survival. TGFL, like the ligands it imitates, appears to promote cell survival and neurite outgrowth.  It is a complex of proteins expressed on the surface of T. cruzi.  Sequencing analyses revealed many of the proteins in TGFL to be T. cruzi ribosomal proteins, including ribosomal proteins L13 and L4. In order to better understand the role of TGFL in T. cruzi infection, L13 and L4 were cloned and bacterially expressed. Although attempts at purification were met with some difficulties, the cloned genes will allow for the eventual purification of the recombinant ribosomal proteins, and elucidation of their role in infection.  Once purified, we will test their biological activity, specifically whether these ribosomal proteins can bind GFRalpha-1,2, or 3 individually, and whether they are capable of promoting neuronal survival and differentiation like TGFL.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_058ed21118b7e4ecf9f203223d2c75e7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3d30e4d3d72d6aa9e56f344e27981308" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effect of Chronic Psychological Stress on the Blood Chemistry of European Starlings (Sturnus Vulgaris)</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.041.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Awerman, Jessica</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_853b9b0f581109afffaf337bbe888fa6">We applied chronic psychological stress by exposing European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to a previously validated chronic stress protocol (CSP) consisting of 4 different randomly applied stressors per day. Experimental design consisted of a 21 day CSP (CSP1), a 60 day recovery (R1), a second 14 day CSP (CSP2), and a second 30 day recovery (R2).  Body weight decreased approximately 5% during CSP1, but overshot to 5-10% above initial body weight during R1.  To investigate underlying mechanisms, we periodically measured corticosterone and 12 biochemical analytes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine kinase (CK), bile acids (BA), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLOB), glucose (GLU), uric acid (UA), calcium (CA++), phosphorus (PHOS), potassium (K+), and sodium (NA+). AST and CK increased at the beginning of CSP1, suggesting muscle breakdown. Additionally, decreases in ALB and TP paired with stable UA, but no associated change in GLU, suggested protein breakdown as a secondary energy source. Changes in blood parameters that occurred during CSP1 did not recover during R1.  During CSP2 and R2, weight loss and gain occurred in different proportions.  CSP2 produced an approximate 15% decrease in body weight and only re-gained 5% body weight during R2, but returned to pre-CSP1 weight.  Corticosterone increased during CSP2 but not during CSP1.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_809cb1d8a026581d06eb2b81db49e0a7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b6e16950ed556e6a4fd21ff98db581ad" level="item"><did><unittitle>Determinants of Host Resistance to Babesiosis, an Emerging Infectious Disease</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.042.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Orloff, Michael Isaac Morrell</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_818468d454c74f2714f086ca71a669b5" label="Books [39090015513480b]" type="box">Volume 42</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4c6489177bdad90436fded8752420b34"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_93bd8cc92bb6aaa57ddc135e8383cf9e" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Immunomodulatory Properties of APE, a Purified Polysaccharide from Acinetobacter venetianus</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.043.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wroblewska, Joanna</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_f63ff9dc839909a7109e718a11a9f513" label="Books [39090015513548b]" type="box">Volume 43</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5e2eb2202e2d491028526e0e3fec9411"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1a7dbbade67ffc96ebb34a41d81a5530" level="item"><did><unittitle>Microvascular remodeling and pathological angiogenesis: A role for bioactive lipids?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.044.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dulmovits, Brian M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_c95a873ab005d857a516c94ef7953eb4" label="Books [39090015513589b]" type="box">Volume 44</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3a3bb2aad379f4c4bb800464c3c8aa8f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_eee704eb1a1750d0ed36c8671eeb3bcc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Formation and Characterization of Nanoparticles Produced by Ionic Complexation of DNA and Protein with an Exopolysaccharide Isolated from Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.045.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bettigole, Sarah</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_fe8ed5cb79e0cbc63b508e7b1f7cbfda" label="Books [39090015513605b]" type="box">Volume 45</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b51a51403b36d97ac7772c2df0ccc136"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_79940071022721b4647665a9a280651e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Chromatography-free Solid Phase Oligosaccharide Synthesis</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.046.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cao, John</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c8e459432eb986248de8a02f8d931fc2">To fill a demand for synthetic oligosaccharides for biochemical study, new methods of synthesis must fill standard in both purity and efficiency. Eliminating the need for chromatography purification during synthesis lessens the manual work needed to synthesize each sequence and allows a greater degree of automation.  This thesis describes a new cap-and tag solid phase oligosaccharide synthesis. Completed sequences were tagged with an alkyne linker-tag and captured onto azide functionalized catch resin using 'click' chemistry. Filtration separated these desired sequences from incomplete 'truncated' sequences. A mannose monomer and a trimannose sequence were synthesized on the solid phase to demonstrate proof of concept.  This method allows synthesis of oligosaccharides without the use of chromatography and is designed for ease with automated parallel synthesis.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_721e09c9857d08ed9ec2bf950f3960a9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fdf5d95fb23e994ae42981cbca413d0b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Mechanisms of expansions of a pentanucleotide repeat responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia 10</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.047.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cherng, Nicole Binanne</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_49a4b49346a2c80fe4bb940882721201">Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by ataxia and, in some cases, epilepsy, which is caused by expansions of the (ATTCT)n repeat within an intron of the ATXN10 gene. The repeat can expand from 10-22 copies in normal individuals up to 4,500 repeats in SCA10 patients. To understand the mechanisms responsible for (ATTCT)n repeat instability, we set up a genetically controlled system to analyze its expansions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By integrating (ATTCT)n repeats into an intron of the selectable gene reporter, we found that they do expand in yeast resulting in the reporter's inactivation. This inactivation is due to the fact that the levels of both unspliced and spliced RNA of the reporter were strongly decreased upon lengthening of the (ATTCT)n repeat in its intron. The rates of expansions dramatically increased with the repeat lengths, mimicking the situation in human pedigrees. We then performed preliminary genetic analysis, by disrupting several genes involved in DNA metabolism. In the &amp;#x0394;tof1 strain, the rate of expansions increased 8-fold suggesting that the Tof1 protein acts to prevent (ATTCT)n repeat expansions. In the &amp;#x0394;rad5 strain, no expansions were observed, implicating that the Rad5 protein is a crucial factor for expansions. We speculate that expansions of (ATTCT)n repeats could occur upon template switching during the replication of repetitive DNA.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8003ecaecaa3669ed7edcbf37fe03819"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ac3b5abac63d352d84b6dfc0d1e13b87" level="item"><did><unittitle>Characterization of the role of Drosophila melanogaster Pol32 in Homologous Recombination and DNA Repair</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.049.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shusterman, Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ca3df5e4ab66dbba0e604d5fa14dfa92">Double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA represent one of the most toxic and dangerous classes of DNA lesions. DSB repair (DSBR) occurs through two canonical pathways, homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). In Drosophila melanogaster, DSBR of P-element induced breaks is believed to occur through the HR pathway known as synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA). A variety of proteins have been implicated in SDSA, but the polymerases involved in initiating and extending repair products have not been fully characterized. The Pol32 subunit of polymerase δ in S. cerevisiae has been found to be necessary for break induced replication and various DNA repair pathways. We hypothesize that the pol32 Drosophila ortholog may also play a role in processive synthesis during HR repair. Two deletion mutations in pol32 utilized in this study were generated by an imprecise P-element excision (L2 and L30). Mutagen sensitivity assays and a site specific DSBR assay were employed to study the mutants. The L2 null mutation was found to be sensitive to a range of mutagens, including MMS and IR, indicating a role for pol32 in base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, replication restart, and HR. Analysis of the repair assay revealed a significant defect in pol32 mutants for HR repair and processive synthesis. These results implicate Pol32 as an important player in DSBR and in the processive synthesis of polymerase &amp;#x03B4;.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a7776d52d35655c90bc4f303937018da"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_aef975c6c068f8ee96a46341f7de5afb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Investigations on the lgx-1 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.050.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Yen, Lawrence L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_dadad483bb9a074bf9c2268d39ba32ce">Lymphatic filariasis affects around 120 million people world wide (WHO), and is caused by nematodes Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti in many developing countries (Duke, 2001). The chitin synthesis and processing pathway may serve as a potential drug target for filariasis as the nematodes that cause the disease produce chitin while vertebrates do not. The model organism chosen for the studies presented in this paper is Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). C. elegans shares the chitin synthesis and processing pathways with other nematodes and its entire genome has previously been sequenced. The lgx-1 gene in C. elegans codes for a putative chitin deacetylase and has been shown to be expressed in the pharynx of the organism by in situ hybridization experiments (Kohara, 2010). We therefore hypothesize that knocking down the lgx-1 gene in C. elegans would affect the function of the pharynx. For this study, we attempted to produce dsRNA of the chitin deacetylase (CDA) region of the lgx-1 gene in vitro to be used for RNAi experiments by soaking.  The in vitro transcription reactions using a short cDNA fragment representing the CDA domain resulted in no sizeable yield of full length transcripts. We also cloned a larger cDNA fragment containing exons 12 -21 of the lgx-1 gene, known as the yk1621B03 construct, into the Litmus 28i vector. As a final part of this study, we performed an RNAi experiment by feeding C. elegans with bacteria expressing dsRNA from two different lgx-1 cDNA fragments. The results showed no significant difference in brood size between the experimental and control populations and an unexpected larger population of nematodes in the experimental samples developing into the L3, L4, and adult stages relative to the control samples.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fecce5ed3f904a7db808f3ffc3c446e1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_dfe03f43cc6dbaf2a8f38ec6e21b97b3" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Role of SFRP1 Expression in Human Breast Cancer</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.051.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Li, Yilun</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e312588a1bd49d7f3f0a0c650ad0411b">Numerous reports in the literature and data from the Yee laboratory suggest that decreased soluble frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) levels are associated with elevated WNT signaling and poor outcome in breast cancer patients. Therefore, we examined whether SFRP1 expression levels provide a useful diagnostic tool to improve clinical outcomes in human breast cancer. The prognostic value of SFRP1 expression was determined by performing the Kaplan- Meier survival analyses on relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in five different microarray databases available from the public domain. In addition, in order to determine whether SFRP1 expression predicts clinical outcomes in combination with other reputable prognostic and predictive markers, the expression levels of SFRP1 in combination with the levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and EGFR receptor 2 (HER2), in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype, and in the basal/luminal subtypes were examined with parametric and non-parametric T-tests to determine which combinations may help improve clinical predictions. The basal/luminal subtypes were determined via clustergram created from expression profiles of six genes in each datasets. Finally, the prognostic values of SFRP1 expression in combination with basal and luminal subtypes were compared to the prognostic values of basal and luminal subtypes alone to determine whether SFRP1 can improve clinical prediction.  Our results have shown that SFRP1 cannot predict the probability of RFS or OS either alone or in combination with the basal/luminal subtypes. However, despite having little success as using SFRP1 expression as a prognostic marker, we showed that in contrast to past assumptions, SFRP1 was overexpressed in ER-underexpressed, non-HER2 overexpressed, TNBC and basal-like breast cancers. These results suggest the potential limitations of SFRP1 and SFRP1 mimentics as therapeutic treatments for breast cancers and called for a need to better understand the role of SFRP1 in breast cancer, especially in the basal-like subtype.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_722eb098df1b8d42d03f0b3bb93d15b0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_70f4c3e0db07b3829fb4f2d7883c54e7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Generation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Patients with Primary Immune Deficiencies</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.052.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ordovas-Montanes, Jose M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fe87f6415f128c6b8f3391ecd8631fde">Primary immune deficiencies (PIDs) are a collection of genetically inherited disorders that affect the proper functioning of the immune system. In a traditional sense, PIDs are major defects in one or more of the major leukocyte subsets which commonly lead to a wide array of different recurrent and opportunistic infections eventually resulting in a very premature death. A major paradigm shift has led to an expansion of the classical definition of a PID as an immunological phenotype to a PID as any defect resulting from inherited errors of immunity that can pose a substantial threat to life. Here we describe the generation and characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) created using a polycistronic lentiviral vector (pHAGE-STEMCCA) expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and cMYC for the study of several PIDs in vitro. We have generated patient-specific iPSC from individuals with T-B-NK+ severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or Omenn Syndrome due to RAG1-defiency. We have also generated iPSC from individuals with an exquisite predisposition to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) due to defects in STAT1, TLR3, or UNC-93B with undefined cellular defects in immunity within the central nervous system. Due to the pluripotency of iPSC derived from skin fibroblasts, we will be able to study human lymphoid differentiation as well as the responsiveness of human neuronal cells to infection. Due to the inability of studying these processes on human cells in vivo, these in vitro disease models represent novel and powerful tools to study the disease process and attempt to develop therapies for the treatment of these diseases.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_07e6bcc486b167947ffb9a8b5b89848a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_458c8e6b606f85b3279189c8c9c9fb11" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Role of TRF4 in the Maintenance of CAG Repeats in Yeast</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.053.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Verra, Lauren N.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_51e93a3c05f4800941b2cd69dd6d2dc3">Trinucleotide repeats are repetitive sequences in the genome prone to both fragility and instability.

Because of this CAG-repeat regions in the genome exhibit higher rates of spontaneous lesions, DNA expansions and contractions than other DNA sequences. In S. cerevisiae the DNA helicases Mph1 and Srs2 are involved in many repair processes, and coordinate which repair process the cell will enter. Because of these important roles, the identification of an Srs2 homologue in Homo sapiens would be medically useful. To accomplish this goal, strategies to replace the SRS2 locus with the human genes hFBH1 and hRTEL1 were designed, and assays for chromosome end loss and CAG repeat expansions/contractions were performed for mph1?. The results obtained show an increase in expansions, contractions, and chromosome end loss in mph11? cells. Bioinformatics studies were also conducted, shedding light on possible Srs2 homology.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a135904903b8c29dcad616fb26c17bc0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Genetic engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0aba018023bb9215d1948f8676912567" level="item"><did><unittitle>Evaluating the time-lagged extinction risk of a migratory species</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.055.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Surya, Gautam S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6674c3567e24b81bd0ebc8c6331058fa">Species extinction is currently reducing the world's biodiversity at an alarming rate. The species-area relationship predicts a decline in the number of species in a landscape as the area of available habitat is reduced. This time-lagged extinction predicted for the future is known as the extinction debt of the landscape. The incidence function model (IFM) is a single-species approach to the multispecies extinction debt model. However, how one should apply it particularly to migrant species is unclear. To date, applications of the IFM have treated migrants as residents, in that they are assumed to return to their natal sites and then disperse. We here apply the IFM to the bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), a grassland obligate breeding bird that migrates every year to South America.  Our modeled study system is Massachusetts grasslands, which exist as a highly fragmented landscape. Under the IFM, the probability of a patch of habitat being occupied is a function of the quality of the habitat, and of the connectivity of the patch within the landscape.  Connectivity, in turn, is a function of the dispersal capacity of the species, as well as the spatial arrangement of habitat patches within the landscape. We used the bobolink to explore a variety of scenarios for determining extinction debt for migrants.  We investigated the sensitivity of the IFM to five measures of habitat quality and four dispersal scenarios. Presence-absence data were obtained from the Massachusetts Audubon Society (MAS) Grassland Bird Database for 59 sites, for the 2005 survey year. One of the dispersal scenarios mimicked bobolink dispersal, which was estimated from published mark-recapture studies, and corrected to account for unmeasured long-distance dispersal (LDD) events. Other dispersal distances evaluated included: no dispersal, unlimited dispersal, and a published dispersal distance.  Quality measures evaluated included area of the grassland patch, available habitat within 1, 3, and 5 km from each patch, and the distance to the nearest patch. We found that varying estimates of dispersal capacity, while keeping the quality measure constant, had a large effect on predicted bobolink persistence as measured by the percentage of habitat patches occupied. Our measures of quality, in contrast, had a small effect on estimated persistence for the estimated dispersal distance obtained from mark-recapture studies without accounting for LDD events. We conclude that obtaining accurate data regarding dispersal, along with data regarding the manner in which the species of interest evaluates its environment, is critical to predicting the persistence of a population on a landscape. In addition, we believe that these results constitute evidence that the IFM should be applied in a species-specific manner, and the results from the IFM for one species cannot be generalized to include all species in a landscape.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b763da291415483bc85df5fa58dcc551"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Extinction (Biology)</subject><subject source="local">Bobolink</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7796a34881455682c17100d1a6e762b3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Period and Clock as Candidate Genes for Pdd, a Major Factor of Voltinism Differences in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.056.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Oh, Jessica S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_01bc54ea5368c0a61b36794086ac1606">Closely related races, strains, or species form the foundation of speciation research. In the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis), closely related strains are characterized by differences in sex pheromone communication and voltinism (generations per year), both of which contribute to reproductive isolation and the speciation process. Previous studies found that a molecular marker on the sex (Z) chromosome, Tpi, exhibits significant allelic differentiation between strains. Evolutionary theory predicts such patterns at genome regions harboring loci for reproductive isolation. Indeed, Tpi is closely linked to Pdd, a gene or set of genes that affect postdiapause development time (PDD), a major factor of voltinism. Based on the genome of Bombyx mori (silkmoth), two genes, Period and Clock, were identified as potential candidates for the Pdd gene. To determine the molecular basis for postdiapause development time, the inheritance patterns of PDD and the genotypes of Period and Clock were determined. Genotyping results showed that both Period and Clock genes are candidates for differences in the PDD phenotype, as very few recombinants were discovered. However, a genealogical analysis of Clock revealed no allelic differentiation between different voltine populations, suggesting that the causal locus for PDD is found elsewhere on the Z chromosome. Nevertheless, genetic variation at both Clock and Period may have important consequences for the extent of gene flow between populations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e42c05614e9f8aabb81184c417bbad14"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Evolution (Biology)</subject><subject source="local">Cladistic analysis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_32ccc914755f4c6428ea3857f6d69a27" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effect of Melatonin of Mast Cell Activation</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.057.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sasenick, Jonathan B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a758b3b59decfe4f5eb1945f785b72b7">Mast cells are a heterogeneous population of inflammatory cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells. Located in nearly all tissues of the body, mast cells have been implicated in allergic disorders, tissue remodeling, wound healing, and immune modulation. Upon activation, mast cells release a variety of both preformed and de novo synthesized chemical mediators through a process known as degranulation. These mediators have been found to have both positive and negative regulatory effects on the immune system, often benefiting the body, but sometimes causing damage. Melatonin is a hormone synthesized primarily in the pineal gland in the brain. It is best known for the regulation of circadian rhythm and its light-dependent synthesis. Melatonin has also been implicated in many of the same diseases as mast cells, including Alzheimer's Disease and many types of cancer, and has shown to be an effective immune regulator in certain systems. Rat mast cells have been shown to express both isotypes (MT1 and MT2) of the melatonin receptor on their cell surfaces.  I hypothesized that HMC-1 human mast cells expressed these same receptors on their cell surface. In addition, I hypothesized that melatonin would interact with these mast cells, causing some change in the degree of mast cell activation. Results from this study not only showed that HMC-1 human mast cells express mRNA messages for MT1 and MT2, but also showed that HMC-1 and rat mast cell activation seem to be partially inhibited by incubation with melatonin. Better understanding of this modulation in mast cell activity could have an impact on the way mast cell interactions are understood and how melatonin is used as a clinical intervention in patients suffering from chronic inflammation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8e0676599aedd234a33a914bf1f435ff"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Mast cells</subject><subject source="local">Melatonin</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_da67a410551562accc71e000ce4d8061" level="item"><did><unittitle>CRF1 Receptor Antagonist Injections Increase Medial Prefrontal Cortex Serotonin after Alcohol Self-Administration</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.058.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Carlson, Julia M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e1da449c5ac4efadd80b6928ba06077a">Aggressive behaviors comorbid with alcohol abuse are a public health crisis.  These behaviors are historically correlated to an inverse concentration of serotonin in the central nervous system.  Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) antagonists that mediate the physiological stress response have recently begun to be developed to treat alcohol abuse.   As CRF modulates serotonergic release, it may affect aggressive behaviors.  A previous behavioral study in our lab found that the CRF1 antagonist CP-154,526 attenuated alcohol-heightened aggression in Carworth Farms Webster (CFW) mice. Based on this experiment, we decided to use in vivo microdialysis to evaluate the change in serotonin concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex following ethanol self-administration, CP-154,526 injection (17 mg/kg intraperitoneal and 0.6 ?g microinjection into the dorsal raphe nucleus), and paired self-administration and acute drug injection.  1 g/kg ethanol self-administered was seen to significantly increase serotonin concentration.  CP-154,526 i.p. administered had no overall effect, but trended towards increasing serotonin concentration.  Acute injections following self-administration increased serotonin concentration, but the microinjection was only compared to its baseline as opposed to an inert vehicle injection.  Overall, serotonin concentration increases following acute injection CP-154,526 and ethanol self-administration correlate to the anti-aggressive effects observed in the previous behavioral study.  CP-154,526 may be a useful therapeutic in treating alcohol abuse comorbid with aggressive behaviors.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d2e6b0d2ee7e2a7c97edfbf2ce3e486d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Alcoholism</subject><subject source="local">Biochemistry</subject><subject source="local">Serotonin</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_48228d5bd8ef5dc069408a287761c097" level="item"><did><unittitle>Differential Gene Expression in a Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.059.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Carnazza, Kathryn E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_df7ca7038658cc41da355d2b21aed7d0">Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal genetic neurodegenerative disorder. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. HD typically manifests itself in middle age, though in some cases, symptoms appear earlier. Patients with HD suffer from a gross motor dysfunction, neuronal atrophy, cognitive impairments, psychiatric disturbances, and metabolic disruption, among other symptoms. Death follows anywhere from 10-25 years after the onset of symptoms. The causative mutation of this disease, a CAGn expansion in the HTT gene, was discovered more than 17 years ago. This gene codes for huntingtin, which is essential for both development and survival of many organisms. However, the exact molecular workings of this disease are still unknown. Partially due to the paucity of this information, there is no cure for the disease, and treatment consists only of controlling certain symptoms to improve quality of life. Research is focused on elucidating the pathways and molecules that contribute to disease progression. Much of this research utilizes animal models of HD, including a mouse model with a CAGn expansion inserted into the murine homologue of HTT.  A collaborative study with the German Mouse Clinic with the aim of better understanding Huntington's disease pathogenesis led to the identification of a number of differentially expressed genes in brain and liver tissues of a knock-in mouse model of the disorder. In this study, we sought to further characterize the expression of a selection of these genes both knock-in and wild-type mice. We employed TaqMan real-time PCR assays to investigate the previously observed changes in expression. The data we collected for a majority of the genes are inconclusive. However, our preliminary results are encouraging for two of the genes, Prok1 and Nfkbia. We found Prok1 to be significantly downregulated in the knock-in mice, and observed downregulation in Nfkbia in the knock-in mice as well. These two genes provide potential avenues for new hypotheses about the disease process in HD.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d51242f9aced2dfbf6fda80bb94e908b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Huntington's chorea</subject><subject source="local">Gene therapy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_28205ef5ddded7241993852bcbb6dbb9" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of RNAi Feeding Experiments To Silence the lgx-1 and F48E3.8 genes of Caenorhabditis elegans</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.060.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brand, Kenneth J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9a1a2a4da28f036f49e4233a6a9a1a06">Lymphatic filariasis affects a large area of the world and current preventative therapies are unable to control and eradicate it.  Both ivermectin and DEC, the current drug treatments, are becoming less desirable because of an increased resistance by adult female worms and harmful side effects to human hosts, respectively (Babu et al., 2006; Osei-Atweneboana et al., 2011).  The structural polymer, chitin, is found in the filarial nematodes that cause elephantiasis as well as in the free living nematode C. elegans (Harris et al., 2000; Zhang, Foster, Nelson, Ma, &amp; Carlow, 2005).  By studying the effects of chitin modification in C. elegans, new preventative methods of lymphatic filariasis may emerge.  This paper looked at the resulting changes to development and surviving progeny of silencing the lgx-1 and F48E3.8 genes, both of which encode putative chitin deacetylase catalytic regions, in C. elegans through RNAi feeding experiments.  Experiments silencing just the lgx-1 gene showed a developmental delay while having no effect on brood size.  Silencing both chitin deacetylase genes shows a combined effect of retarded development as well as a significant decrease in mean brood size.  Silencing the lgx-1 gene, expressed in the pharynx, may prevent complete elongation of the feeding organ resulting in a slower distribution of nutrients to the growing worm.  The decrease in fertility seen by knocking down the F48E3.8 gene indicates that the conversion to chitosan is crucial in the control of pharyngeal elongation in developing embryos or ability to hatch from eggshells.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_352f41161d8f567c0ff448e280ecb4d2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Elephantiasis</subject><subject source="local">Genetic engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_553785d2214841c7d667e198ce014a6e" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effect of Learning on Heart Rate and Behavior of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.061.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Glassman, Laura Wallis</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ce949a8710261cc7a853f3beceac3906">Five wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were exposed to a learning task in order to determine whether heart rate (HR) and behavior responses to the learning are similar to changes seen during chronic stress conditions. Birds performed a task in a closed economy that required them to discriminate between images of opposite convexity (one concave and one convex) based on shading cues, a task that a previous unpublished study (Qadri et al., 2010) demonstrated that starlings can learn.  Once the starlings learned the task, we changed the task in three ways: (1) we manipulated the angle and shape of the image; (2) we altered the availability of the task; (3) and we reversed the positive stimulus.  During each of these changes we measured the effects of having to adapt previously established behaviors and learn new ones. Learning the discrimination task did not appear to chronically stress the starlings.  They decreased their HR, rather than the predicted stress-induced increase, in response to the training and original discrimination treatments. However, HR increased when the task became unavailable and decreased upon its return, showing that the birds were capable of mounting a physiological response to a condition perceived as stressful. Behaviors measured included the accuracy of responses, the number of trials/min, and the number of perch hops/min, the later serving as a measure of activity within the testing section of the cage. Birds decreased the number of trials/min in the first day of the discrimination task and reversal treatment. The number of trials/min increased through the initial learning period of these treatments, as did the success rate, suggesting that starlings may try to conserve energy expenditure when they have less access to food. This is also supported by the decrease in perch hops/min when the task was unavailable, and the subsequent increase upon its return. Overall, these results suggest that learning per se is not a stressor for wild animals.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d3b00dde7c1a2502f9e7108ca143f23d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Sturnus vulgaris--Effects of stress on</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_be45aec0dcd84f6391956fe47eeaf5db" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Neurotensin-Induced Release Pathway of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in Human Mast Cells</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.062.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kearns, Malcolm D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_533e0c60de648b6892725c1cc25a3d70">Mast cells are immunocompetent cells located throughout the body, their function dictated by the specific microenvironments of the tissues in which they reside.  Storing or synthesizing de novo a variety of chemicals, mast cells release mediators by selective secretion or compound exocitosis that are involved in host defense, allergy, inflammation, and in the growth of some tumors.  One such mediator, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), is crucial to both physiological angiogenesis and the angiogenesis associated with pathological conditions such as tumor growth. Our lab has previously shown that the neuroendocrine peptide neurotensin (NT) causes an increase in the expression of VEGF isoforms in HMC-1 cells mast cells and mediates VEGF release through an NT-specific NTS-1 receptor. This project sought to confirm and extend these findings by exploring additional 'downstream' components of the VEGF release pathway, identifying several enzyme mediators that, when selectively inhibited, block the release of VEGF following NT stimulation. Selectively inhibiting MEK1 MAPK, PKC, PKA, p38 MAPK, and PI3-Kinase have shown significant decreases in VEGF release following NT-stimulation of HMC-1 cells. In addition, a Zinc chelator blocked the release of VEGF.  Western blotting was used to confirm these observations.  This research may be applied to the understanding of human cancers, as mast cells have been shown to accumulate around various tumors.  In addition, various cancer cells have been shown to secrete NT. Thus, the release of a pro-angiogenic factor from mast cells by NT stimulation may be tied to the blood supply required by growing tumors.  Knowledge of these cellular interactions may provide valuable insight into tumor growth and development.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6fc6f44020f89d47ef6436090f73a13e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Mast cells</subject><subject source="local">Neovascularization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4631a51d8fe305133501f312a22e794c" level="item"><did><unittitle>RNAi knockdown of a putative chitin deacetylase in Caenorhabditis elegans</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.063.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rogers, Meredith C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_804f0991269ea9acdf03ff336150378e">Filarial parasites pose a major problem to the developing world, yet treatments for infections by parasitic nematodes are limited, and not always effective.  Recent studies have shown that drug resistance is emerging, which emphasizes the gap that needs to be filled by a new treatment option.  Chitin metabolism in the nematode is an appealing target for new drugs, as this process is not shared by mammalian hosts. Chitin deacetylase (CDA), which converts chitin into chitosan, is present in the pharynx of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism for parasitic worms.  Here, we examine the RNAi knockdown of one putative chitin deacetylase gene, F48E3.8.  RNAi experiments show that this knockdown is associated with reductions in brood size, and may also cause developmental delays.  We also attempted to visualize the morphology associated with CDA knockdown using eosin Y, a specific stain for chitosan.

The second most highly expressed common fragile site, FRA16D, is located within the WWOX tumor suppressor gene and has been associated with chromosomal instability in various cancers. Flex1 is a ~500 bp AT-rich region located within FRA16D and contains a polymorphic (AT)n dinucleotide repeat. The Flex1 region has been shown to increase chromosome fragility in a yeast model system. We used a direct repeat recombination assay in S. cerevisiae to examine the effect of the length of the perfect AT repeat embedded within the Flex1 region on chromosome breakage. We observed an increase in the rate of chromosome breakage that is dependent on the length of the perfect AT repeat. However, for the Flex1 sequences that lack 102 bp of the 3'-end sequence that is predicted to easily extrude to form a 17 bp hairpin, the rate of breakage was significantly lower. These results indicate that the 17 bp hairpin-prone sequence strongly inhibits recovery of broken chromosomes in the assay. Though the exact mechanism of inhibition is unknown, a potential mechanism is that the 17 bp hairpin interferes with resection at a double stranded break needed to expose complementary single stranded DNA for homologous recombination. The main finding of this study is that there is a correlation between the rate of chromosome breakage and the secondary structure-forming propensities among the perfect AT repeats within the AT-rich Flex1 sequence. Therefore, we propose that a hairpin (from a single-stranded DNA) and/or cruciform (from dsDNA) structure formed by the AT repeat in the Flex1 region contributes to chromosome breakage.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_07e4f4b324f2a2234eb070c88b9c478b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Genetics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fe6c0cb781fb45a252b5f391c42851bf" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of Genetic Diversity on thermoregulation in Apis mellifera</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.065.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Foo, Bill</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ff5e47097b6d1833cdbe5750f3f531cc">Honeybee queens mate with a large number of males. In our experiment, our honeybee queens mated with between 20-37 males. The evolution of hyperpolyandry in honeybees (Apis mellifera) is an interesting phenomenon, given that it will reduce the average relatedness amongst workers and potentially decrease the fitness benefits derived from cooperation. Past studies have suggested that mating with up to 10 males can be explained as a mechanism to decrease the production of genetic misfits (i.e. diploid males). The benefits of polyandry beyond 10 matings are poorly understood, although recent studies have shown some fitness benefits of hyperpolyandry on disease resistance, behavioral traits, and colonial thermoregulation.  We were interested in the benefits of genetic diversity on colony thermoregulation. We examined the relationship between thermoregulation and genetic diversity quantified as the patriline number of the colonies. We predicted that stability of thermoregulation, measured as temperature variance in the brood comb would correlate positively with patriline number. In addition, we explored the mechanism for the pathogenesis of behavioral fever in response to Ascosphaera apis infection. Based on previous experiments, we predicted that our experimental hives would increase brood comb temperature in response to A. apis spores.  Our data suggest that increasing genetic diversity is not a predictor of thermoregulatory stability. Although genetic diversity may have fitness benefits in hive development, stability of thermoregulation does not seem to be influenced by genetic diversity in naturally foraging, naturally mated colonies. Our results revealed that specific temperature conditions are relevant to the pathogenesis of behavioral fever against A. apis in honeybee colonies. During the experiment, our experimental colonies failed to mount a behavioral fever when they were exposed to A. apis spores at an ambient temperature of ~33oC, which is above the germination temperature of A. apis. This result suggests that there is a temperature requirement in the generation of group fever in honeybee.  Surprisingly, our results also showed a food-influenced temperature circadian rhythm in honeybees. When the colonies were given a sugar feed, hive temperatures were no longer correlated with ambient temperature, and comparison between the no-feed and feed periods showed a different thermoregulatory pattern. Although using food as an external cue for circadian patterns had been observed in organisms such as mice, a "food-related clock" in a superorganism has never been seen until now.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_824a8b9e24ec106534cf6e0ac0592dc3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Genetics</subject><subject source="local">Honeybee</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_25dfc832f45a2117724d9d9e440434a1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Fictive Crawling in Manduca Sexta: the role of central pattern generators in the neural control of soft-bodied locomotion</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.066.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Slate, Daniel J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d11d3428737800860e3189ea56dbc534">Central pattern generators are well characterized in a variety of species and are thought to control vital biological functions. These pattern generators function effectively with little to no sensory feedback. Fictive behaviors provide a method of examining the existence of central pattern generators. In Manduca sexta, the larvae's lack of a rigid skeleton poses challenges to the control of the caterpillar's locomotion. Previous research has suggested that central pattern generators play a role in the caterpillar's locomotion. This study examines fictive behaviors induced in an isolated central nerve cord from the caterpillar to answer the following questions: (1) What role, if any does sensory feedback play in coordinating the motor output of the central nervous system, and (2) what role do central pattern generators play in motor patterns generated by the caterpillar's central nervous system. It was found that though some well coordinated rhythms are generated by an isolated nerve cord, these patterns are far more diverse and variable than previously thought. This diversity and variability of motor patterns suggests that, while central pattern generating neural circuits may exist in the caterpillar CNS, sensory feedback plays a critical role in coordinating these patterns to produce the behaviors observed in the intact animal. These findings ultimately have implications on the design of an intelligent control system for soft-bodied robotics.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8ddbd7195020f7b821fecd62d5308243"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tobacco hornworm</subject><subject source="local">Neurophysiology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_45bff8990f0b3b2d9d1800e02fe4629b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Can You Tell Your Left From Your Right?

However, the internal arrangement of organs within vertebrates does not follow suit, as multiple organs are positioned asymmetrically in a consistently biased manner. Determining how asymmetry is established is important not only for the field of developmental biology but also for medical applications. Multiple models have been put forth to explain the establishment of asymmetric organ laterality. The cytoplasmic flow model, supported by pharmacological and molecular genetic data, postulates that ion transporters are positioned asymmetrically within the early embryo due to the inherent chirality of the cytoskeleton, creating a gap junction-dependent electrochemical gradient that asymmetrically localizes charged molecules such as serotonin. In this way, serotonin may be thought of as a left-right morphogen, whose biased localization leads to asymmetric downstream gene expression, distinguishing between left and right. One key question that remains for this model is how the cytoskeletal architecture is interpreted to asymmetrically localize ion transporters. Because Rab GTPases regulate nearly all aspects of membrane trafficking, we hypothesized that Rab GTPases were responsible for the directed, asymmetric shuttling of ion pumps and channels. We found that DN and WT injections of Rab11 and Rab5 randomize organ situs. In addition, we quantified the localization of ion transporters previously shown to be asymmetrically expressed, as well as some ion transporters that have not been characterized, at the 4-cell stage in Xenopus embryos. We demonstrated that the asymmetric expression of these ion transporters is dependent on proper Rab11 and Rab5 function. Co-localization of either Rab11 or Rab5 with ductin, the small c subunit of the H+-V-ATPase, further indicates that Rab11 and Rab5 could be directly controlling ion transporter localization. We propose that Rab GTPases regulate left-right asymmetry by directing the asymmetric localization of ion transporters in the early embryo along the chiral cytoskeleton.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a7b52bf333a1a253623e978ac8bbc49f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_f23f4ca2908721152f29a9823e4fdd35" level="item"><did><unittitle>Screening cyclic peptide libraries for allosteric modulators of heat shock protein 90, and, Small cyclic peptides may induce interstitial telomeric repeat expansions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.068.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Le, Linda T.T.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_234d7612c22997a389b5aabfe20acb0f">Several cancers and neurological diseases are characterized by abnormal protein chaperone function. At the basal level, molecular chaperones facilitate correct protein folding as well as the prevention of improper associations between proteins (Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005). Included in these chaperones is a highly conserved group of proteins called the heat shock proteins (Hsp), which are upregulated when the cell is subjected to heat or general stress conditions. Heat shock protein 90 is of particular interest due to its critical role in both wild-type and diseased cell survival, and therefore, its potential as a target to treat diseases that require its chaperone activity. Here, I present a unique chemical genetics approach to altering Hsp90 function in two temperature-sensitive strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cyclic peptides are an underexplored class of molecules that have been previously shown in the literature to exhibit drug-like properties (Kritzer et al., 2009). I carried out a novel method of screening for cyclic peptides that exploits their potential role as allosteric modulators of Hsp90 using simple yeast genetics. Although I report negative findings, this method may be used in the future for rapid, inexpensive, and efficient screening of cyclic peptide libraries against other Hsp90 mutants.

Telomeres are repeating units of DNA found both at the ends and middle of linear chromosomes. These structures contribute to chromosome stability and extension during DNA replication. Proper functioning of the telomerase enzyme is crucial for maintaining chromosomal integrity as well as the lifespan of the cell. Aberrant telomere activity has been implicated in cancer and age-related diseases. Even so, the role of interstitial telomeric sequences remains largely unknown. Interactions between cyclic peptides and telomeres could shed light on the mechanisms by which interstitial repeats act within the chromosome, and could have direct implications in drug discovery for treating telomere-related disorders. Here, we explore the potential role of 8-mer cyclic peptides in stimulating human interstitial telomeric repeat expansions in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast model. Cyclic peptides were synthesized using Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis and applied to yeast via pull-down assays. This study is currently in progress.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5ad0819b99320d1016c89cc22449b589"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_e7de351cd0c9b90ff805295db8dc9f17" level="item"><did><unittitle>A model system to study contractions of the (GAA)n repeats in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.069.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shimberg, William Reed</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9ef31fefb73a3ae5cceaedafb3f98f46">DNA naturally contains many repetitive sequences some of which are dinucleotide, trinucleotide, pentanucleotide and dodecanucleotide repeats. Some repetitive sequences can form unusual structures in the DNA, which can interfere with replication, transcription, and repair processes and cause instability of the DNA. This instability can be detected as expansions or contractions in the length of the original repeats. Many human diseases are caused by the expansion of repetitive DNA. Expansion of a GAA repeat in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene in humans is one such example. When the GAA run expands beyond a length threshold of approximately 70 repeats, FXN gene expression is affected, ultimately resulting in Freidreich_�_s ataxia. While extensive research is being carried out on the molecular mechanisms of GAA repeat expansions, relatively few studies focus on their contractions. However, understanding contraction processes is important, as it might help revert the expanded FXN gene in diseased individuals and alleviate their symptoms. To understand mechanisms of contractions of GAA repeats, we were interested in identifying genes involved in the contraction process. Due to difficulties of running a genetic screen in human cells, we modeled GAA repeat contractions in a yeast system. This system was used to conduct a genetic screen to identify genes involved in the contraction process. In total, we identified 16 genes, some of which appear to affect the frequency of contractions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_358177669a190cd86af53b540bcd20ea"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_30c516764d75ecc630c0426b403f9401" level="item"><did><unittitle>A novel pathway for Mus301 mediated DNA repair at Replication forks in Drosophila melanogaster</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.070.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hui, Carrie Ka</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2b1d706f49220c0a90207043bb33b535">Scientists studying genome integrity are particularly interested in DNA double-stranded break repair. One gene that may be involved in DNA repair in Drosophila melantogaster is mus301. Previous research suggested a role for mus301 in homologous recombination (HR), but the mechanism by which Mus301 operates remains largely unknown. Through gene characterization, we report here that mus301 mutants are sensitive to DNA damaging agents: topotecan and hydroxyurea, which are known for their role in causing stalled and collapsed forks. Sensitivity to these chemicals suggested that Mus301 operates at replication forks to repair damage. In addition we generated mus301, spn-A double mutants to study the role of mus301 in alternative end joining repair. Interestingly, these double mutants were homozygous lethal, suggesting that mus301 has a role outside of HR. To further understand the lethal phenotype we analyzed double mutant larvae development. The results from this analysis showed that double mutants were able to survive to first instar larvae, but death occurred rapidly after. Furthermore, to visualize damage in these mutants, we created mus301 homozygous, spn-A heterozygous mutants that were able to survive to third instar. Imaginal disc were collected from these mutants and cell death in these tissue was visualized with acridine orange. Results showed increased foci of damage in the mutants and in combination with the results from the double mutant development analysis this suggested that mus301, spn-A homozygous flies were unable to survive due to a defect in replication. From our results here, we propose a model in which Mus301 serves to unwind DNA structures at stalled replication forks to allow for replication to bypass the inhibition on the DNA template that originally caused the fork to stall or collapse.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6272158a7d0475f4d3fc1c0530d8aed2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_52483e61f25a2b956f881afd37d26c62" level="item"><did><unittitle>A System for Detecting Polyglutamine-Encoding Repeat Expansion Events In Mammalian Cells</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.071.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gennert, David G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_12a198a28cbc90b8d67cbdbdd8fc565d">More than ten human hereditary diseases are known to be caused by the CAGn trinucleotide repeat expansion.  The genome of an afflicted individual contains a region of a repeated CAG sequence that has expanded, i.e. increased in repeat number, above a certain threshold.  Huntington's disease is one of the best-known CAG expansion diseases, which develops when more than 35 repeats accumulate within a specific protein-coding sequence. 
\
	We are developing a selection system that would be able to detect a single expansion event in mammalian cells.  This system utilizes the HyTK fusion protein, which makes cells resistant to the antibiotic hygromycin and sensitive to the antiviral agent ganciclovir at the same time.  We have introduced CAG repeat sequences ranging from 11 to 158 trinucleotide repeats in-frame between the two domains of the fusion protein.  A repeat number above the phenotypic threshold, much like in human huntingtin, are expected to inactivate the synthesized protein, thus conferring sensitivity to hygromycin and resistance to ganciclovir.  Finding this threshold and creating a repeat number just below it is the key to developing a system to study individual expansion events.
\
	The Hy(CAG)nTK construct was then targeted via site-specific recombination to a specific locus in the genome of MEL cells, and integrants were selected in the hygromycin-containing media. No repeat expansions/contractions were found in GanR cells derived from CAG28, CAG39 or CAG53 repeat lengths. CAG85, CAG103 and CAG158 repeat lengths are currently under ganciclovir selection. The largest repeat tract we developed, CAG158, has undergone frequent deletion events during the process of acquiring targeted clones in the presence of hygromycin, suggesting a rejection of this length in most clones and an approximation to an upper limit to study the range of CAG repeats that are themselves not toxic to cells but can induce expansion events to above this toxic threshold. 
\
	Further developing this model will allow researchers to investigate the effects of various factors on the expansion of the repeat sequence in a system that produces a selectable phenotype, loss of TK function.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fe4c4a217b15b9888bf25c44b907b92c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_31c403c02e7ac3ea015965afa4b64087" level="item"><did><unittitle>Neuromechanical control of locomotion in larval Manduca sexta</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.072.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Vaughan, Samuel Cordes</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_47e22a1b7f729da16113c8b6531e3f1c">Larval Manduca sexta, the tobacco hornworm, are remarkable climbers and crawlers.

In order to maintain motion, they must have one or more motor strategies, but the must be able to move in virtually limitless orientations. They are also interesting because Manduca sexta are completely soft and lack any rigid support structure. This research explored how larval Manduca sexta move in vertical and horizontal orientations. A finding of this research was that the proleg gripping system is used to provide a passive resistance to pitch back. Kinematic study of the proleg withdrawal mechanism was then used to determine how robust release is accomplished. This study found that they animals are able to move the gripping hooks on their feet inward, presumably to release tension on the hooks before withdrawal.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3017f250bb5b4edd3bfe964dd0d70b1e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_690102c7c98a4f8dbc9e6cc5f5e76323" level="item"><did><unittitle>Resource allocation shifts in response to herbivory and the consequences for tolerance in Solanum lycopersicum</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.073.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Korpita, Timothy M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a2fe190f730b25a75d6f7ef5dc33b2a6">Herbivory is a major stress to which plants have adapted a number of strategies designed to mitigate its negative consequences. There is increasing evidence that one of these strategies, tolerance, or the ability to recover from the herbivory event, can be affected by a shift in resource allocation patterns induced by herbivory. Based on the evidence for this induced resource shift, a model was proposed that attempts to explain the mechanisms behind it and its adaptive significance. The model predicts that in response to herbivory, resources will be remobilized from attacked tissues to storage in herbivore inaccessible tissues, and these stored resources will be utilized later in regrowth of the lost and damaged tissues, ultimately increasing tolerance. The goal of this thesis was to characterize and quantify this resource allocation shift, confirm experimentally the predicted increase in tolerance and mechanisms behind it, and provide directions for future study. The data presented in chapter 2 demonstrate a resource shift and a subsequent increase in tolerance. The data presented in chapter 3, show that there is not a net removal of resources from herbivore accessible tissues as predicted by the induced sequestration model. Based on these results, and evidence from the literature, we refine and expand the induced sequestration model in chapter 4, as well as suggest avenues for further investigation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7c8d5c44cf0928cae385d49db7c94876"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_8a2b23f21d9741656f5b0057b0e7f11c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Constructing a model to test the effects of transcription on CAG repeat instability in yeast</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.074.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jong, Robyn M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c65d426cdb28a45110f6d143dd41bb1f">Trinucleotide repeats have been associated with numerous hereditary neurological disorders in humans. The inheritance of these diseases correlates with the tendency of tandem trinucleotide repeats to expand and contract in length, a phenomenon called instability. In recent years, transcription through repeat tracts has been shown to destabilize CAG repeat lengths in human cells, mice, and Drosophila melanogaster. However, no model system for studying transcription through trinucleotide repeats currently exists for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To create a model to test this, based off of the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) system used in the Freudenreich laboratory, two different YAC constructs with either CAG or CTG tracts transcribed, were designed with inducible transcription through the repeat tract. Repeat transcription in the new system will be controlled by an inducible GAL1 promoter, while basal read-through transcription of the repeats from a nearby URA3 gene will be reduced by the insertion of a CYC1 transcription termination sequence downstream of URA3. Subcloning was utilized to assemble these three components in their desired orientations and locations and then prepare them for integration into the CF1 YAC. One of these constructs is nearing completion while the other will require two more cloning steps before the final YAC can be achieved. These models will allow novel investigations to determine the effects of transcription and transcription-related processes on CAG repeat instability in yeast.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_55f63cb7bbf53d7e4e34dbb34b08e6d5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_b5f3f00f9c9bcb3c49155b6f4b57a066" level="item"><did><unittitle>Comparing Corticosteroid Receptor mRNA and Protein Expression in House Sparrows (Passer domesticus)</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.075.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Medina, Carlos O</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e0070a2d112e5f3170a18f8969687da2">The stress response represents an organism_�_s attempt to cope with a noxious stimulus and results in a rapid release of corticosterone (CORT) into the bloodstream, resulting in a suite of physiological and behavioral changes. These changes are not mediated by CORT directly however, but by the receptors that CORT binds to. The high affinity Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) is almost constitutively bound to circulating baseline CORT and maintains metabolism and provides permissive roles for the stress response. The low affinity Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) is only bound under high concentrations of CORT, so stress-induced levels, and has roles in inhibition of physiological functions not necessary for survival, such as growth and reproduction, as well as roles in increasing vigilance, information storage, and blood glucose concentrations.
\
	Recently, some studies have attempted to discuss physiological changes due to receptor concentrations by using mRNA as a proxy for functional protein. Studies in different species tell different stories, yet this correlation has not yet been confirmed with GR and MR in House Sparrows (Passer domesticus). To test this assumption, we ran a paralleled procedure in which protein levels were quantified using one half of 16 House Sparrow brains in a radioligand binding assay, and mRNA levels were quantified using the other brain half in RT-qPCR. Two reference genes, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and TATA-Box Binding Protein (TBP), were used for relative quantification of GR and MR mRNA.
\
	We found no correlation between mRNA and protein expression for either GR or MR with both reference genes, suggesting that one cannot serve as a proxy for the other. This study serves to clarify previous assumptions and provide insight into the importance of regulation between mRNA and functional protein.

Though the epidemiology of babesiosis highlights the importance of the host immune response, the mechanisms of host resistance remain poorly understood. Using a forward genetic approach that takes advantage of a clear phenotypic difference between the susceptible DBA/2 (D2) and the resistant C57BL/6 (B6) mouse strains, Dr. Vannier_�_s laboratory mapped the main determinant of host resistance to the proximal/mid region of mouse chromosome 9. I infected several B6.D2 congenic strains and fine mapped this determinant to a seven gene interval. I established that the susceptibility conferred by D2 alleles in this interval requires D2 alleles at a distal locus. I also mapped a proximal determinant for which the D2 allele confers resistance. As determinants of resistance may modulate the immune response, I characterized some of the immune requirements for resistance to B. microti infection. I established that B cells are necessary for resolution of parasitemia in D2 mice and in B6 mice rendered susceptible by interferon-gamma (IFN-�_) receptor 1 gene deficiency. I demonstrated that the B cell-mediated resolution of parasitemia in cd4-deficient mice involves neither IFN-�_ nor Fc�_ receptors, although the resolution is concomitant with a rise in circulating IgG. I established that the complement factor C3 hastens resolution of parasitemia in B6 mice, thereby laying the foundation for experiments that will investigate the contribution of C3 to the B cell-mediated resolution of parasitemia in D2 and cd4-deficient B6 mice. I established that CD4-CD8- T cells are sufficient to confer partial resolution of parasitemia when transferred into infected rag1-deficient mice and gathered evidence that the full resolution may require a coordinated action between CD4-CD8- T cells and B cells. In sum, I mapped several genetic determinants of host resistance to B. microti infection and delineated immune requirements for resolution of B. microti parasitemia in susceptible hosts.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_da8fbd5af2e35ac2ea19be514e3716f1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_566032000ddfedc0b7bdde8e433eb1ef" level="item"><did><unittitle>The effect of the overexpression of DNA polymerase theta in Drosophila melanogaster</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.077.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dukhovich, Anna</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3442ee2472feb901a74cf4a9a139d3a5">The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of upregulation of DNA polymerase theta (Pol ), encoded by the gene mus308, in Drosophila melanogaster. This study was inspired by the recent findings that Pol  is upregulated in human breast and other cancers, and that patients with upregulated levels of the protein had poor clinical outcomes. Homologues of DNA Pol  exist in higher metazoans as well as humans. In Drosophila, Pol  is a protein that participates in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and double strand breaks. Pol  has a helicase-like domain and a polymerase domain. Our laboratory has shown that Drosophila with mutated versions of the Pol  protein are unable to repair DNA using alternative end joining, are more sensitive to interstrand crosslinking agents and also show some phenotypic abnormalities when other DNA repair proteins are also mutated. To date, the role of Pol  mainly has been studied by mutating or knocking out mus308, but the effect of gene overexpression has not been considered.  In this investigation, Pol  was overexpressed either in the entire organism or separately in the female germline. The overexpressors were analyzed by conducting hatch rate assay of the larvae, and, in case of ubiquitous overexpression, performing mutagen sensitivity assays using nitrogen mustard to determine the flies' resistance to interstrand crosslinks. Drawing from the results, both types of overexpressors have a lower hatch rate, and flies overexpressing Pol  ubiquitously also show slightly more resistance to interstrand crosslinks. From these results, the effect of Pol  upregulation in Drosophila is presently unclear, but it appears that appropriate Pol  levels are important for genomic stability in cells undergoing rapid division, similar to what is observed in human cancers.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_80e89a745171c6883ff42da0231e8410"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Biology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9692d23660b035ac773b88c401663ce7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Epidemiology of Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrheal Isolates in the United States as a Function of Strain Variants Identified Using a Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Technique</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.078.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stone, Samuel M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_72e26c986896259eab7eb9625ffe1843">Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is currently one of the most concerning nosocomial problems in the industrialized world.

Typically, animals avoid novel objects in their environment, although there is considerable variation in the magnitude and duration of neophobia between species. This behavior was tested in European starlings by removing their food overnight and replacing it in the morning. When novel objects were placed at or near the food dish, birds responded with increased latencies to approach the food dishes. Repeated exposure to the same object on consecutive days resulted in attenuation of the increases in latency and thus the animals exhibited rapid habituation to the objects.  This stress response culminates in the secretion of corticosterone (CORT) from the adrenal cortex and enables an animal to respond to environmental threats. In Chapter 1, I tested the hypothesis that stress induces boldness and reduces neophobia. Contrary to expectations, however, when the stress response was activated prior to the birds' exposure to novel objects via restraint in a cloth bag for 15 minutes, neophobia increased. Furthermore, activation of the stress response in combination with repeated exposure to an object resulted in the extinguishing of the habituation described earlier. When animals were directly injected with CORT prior to novel object exposure, there was no effect on behavior, suggesting that even though stress appears to augment the neophobic response to novel objects, it is not regulated through CORT.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_88a1620f7f21a5b61a35d64936e084d6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Biology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8496a6305da1f1413b6ef5ea8215bc99" level="item"><did><unittitle>Determining the Signal Transduction Pathway Utilized in the Production of TNF- in Neurotensin-treated HMC-1 Human Mast Cells</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.080.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Saurman, Virginia E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ab3dc6043e645b6e13ae23450a66e66c">The purpose of this experiment was to determine the signal transduction pathway(s) that are activated to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in HMC-1 human mast cells upon stimulation with neurotensin (NT). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the calcium ionophore A23187 were used as positive controls to elicit TNF- production in HMC-1, as these had been previously confirmed. Other mediators which have been shown to induce TNF- production from other immune cells were also tested on HMC-1 (e.g. Substance P, CRH, Bradykinin). These mediators were combined with 10 _M NT to see if there was any change in TNF- levels. They were then combined with their respective signal transduction pathway inhibitors and/or NT to see if they worked via these pathways in HMC-1. Likewise, NT was combined with the positive controls to determine if there were additive or synergistic effects on TNF- production. Levels of TNF- were measured using ELISA. The results of these experiments indicate that PMA is the most potent mediator of TNF- production, while A23187 is second.  Substance P and CRH produce levels of TNF- in HMC-1 similar to those produced by 10 _M NT. The results also show that there is an additive effect when these mediators are combined with 10 _M NT.  NFB, MAPK, PLC_ pathway inhibitors all reduced TNF- levels to near basal levels in 10 _M NT stimulated HMC-1 cells.  As the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway seemed most promising, we then turned our attention to confirming the ELISA results with Western Blot. The results indicate that U0126 successfully inhibits phospho-p44 and p42 production in NT-stimulated HMC-1 cells.  Overall, these finding demonstrate that stimulation of HMC-1 human mast cells by NT results in the production of TNF- via the MAPK signaling pathway. The results from ELISAs for inhibitors of NFB and PLCB need to be confirmed via Western Blot.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9d069533930f8b54fb20ee4633e5162f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Biology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ded3de89905370080de0d6bd38bcbcca" level="item"><did><unittitle>Male choice in a nuptial-gift giving butterfly (Pieris rapae)</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.081.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mowery, Monica A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7e79ee1f3a96846c19a8c7c45e4cdb4b">Sexual selection is an important evolutionary process, though little research has examined what factors males use to evaluate females. This study on Pieris rapae, the cabbage butterfly, manipulated female wing coloration (pterin removal) and size (larval diet manipulation), then evaluated these characteristics as potential cues for male mate choice and allocation to nuptial gifts. Males approached control females more often than they approached less colorful pterin-extracted females. Male larval diet was manipulated to determine if mating behavior differed for resource-limited males. Preference for control females was intensified in diet-restricted males. Mating outcomes did not differ between small and large females. To examine post-copulatory choice, I measured size and nutrient content of spermatophores transferred to large and small females. Spermatophores transferred to large and small females were similar in size, but those transferred to large females were more carbon and nitrogen-rich. Lastly, male choice was examined by determining mating history and UV/visible wing coloration in field-caught females. No relationship was found between wing coloration and mating history, or wing coloration and total number of eggs. This study expanded knowledge of both pre- and post-copulatory male choice.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9041bef26ad760e17796b7b417a0bdfc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Biology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e7072ae7820f5b2d6fd0f3ea86a01420" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Efficacy of Polylysine, Lysine Monomer and Polyethylene Glycol as Excipients for the Controlled Release of Nerve Growth Factor from Freeze Dry Silk Scaffolds</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.082.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Daruvala, Sanaya T.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5d3de929e15ee9350f5bcd746048a693">The controlled release of nerve growth factor (NGF) from 2D freeze-dry silk fibroin scaffolds impregnated with various excipients was studied. It is important to develop a suitable release mechanism of NGF from silk scaffolds because it can potentially provide a more effective clinical method for treating conditions such as peripheral nerve injury. This study also advances our knowledge of drug delivery in silk scaffolds by quantifying excipient effects on a positively charged protein from the scaffolds. Results may provide guidelines for controlling the release rate of growth factors for other tissue engineering purposes. The porous, NGF-loaded silk scaffolds were prepared with either polylysine, lysine monomer, or polyethylene glycol to see the effect of each on the release mechanism. The excipients were loaded at three different loading levels (0%, 1%, and 10%) and NGF release from the scaffolds was measured over the course of one week. Cumulative release curves were fitted to the power law model to quantify the kinetics of the release and indicate the most relevant release mechanism. The effect of each scaffold type on neuron growth was also studied. SH-SY5Y cells were seeded onto these scaffolds to observe the effect of each excipient on neural growth and differentiation. DRG neuron growth and axon extension was also examined and used as a model for peripheral nerve repair. By observing the effect of these excipients on the cells, we can find a system that approaches a zero-order release mechanism while simultaneously promoting cell growth. Results suggest that polylysine is preferable at low loading levels because it causes the release mechanism to approach zero-order. However, in high doses, we found polylysine to be toxic to both DRGs and SH-SY5Y cells. At higher loading levels, PEG is preferable because it increases the mass NGF released and promotes neurite extension.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d2fd0dd97b272380d394f627825bd96e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Biology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a5f247748da3fcc1f629c30c5a4278c6" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Phenotypic Screen Identifies Cyclic Peptide Compounds that Induce Repeat Expansion in Yeast</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.083.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Economos, Nicholas G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c7b8d18e3c2c92a46552e6183c30dae2">Expansion of repeat sequences in the eukaryotic genome can result in dangerous consequences often implicated in the pathology of severe human diseases. Out-of-context telomeric extension in immortalized cancer cell lines and expanded GAA repeat tracts in sufferers of the disease Friedreich's ataxia are two such examples. The mechanisms related to repeat expansion have been widely investigated, but are poorly understood and likely complex. To identify small molecules that may induce repeat expansion and to further understand these mechanisms, we developed a phenotypic screening system to identify small cyclic peptides that induce the expansion of tandem repeat sequences modeled in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using a large intracellularly constructed cyclic peptide library. This paper presents the isolation and characterization of three cyclic peptides that demonstrate inverted human telomeric repeat expansion activity after screening an initial pool of 125,000 transformants. Further analyses reveal that all three of the isolated peptides additionally induce expansion in GAA repeats modeled in a similar system. This work showcases the efficient ability of our screening system to identify agents with repeat expanding properties and highlights three interesting molecules that induce instability in at least two different repeat sequences.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_086ba0878c20dca8e2359622598ee215"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Biology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8bc610d81c6a7c2791edbbb6f4862101" level="item"><did><unittitle>On the Role of the HBP1 Transcription Factor in Epileptogenesis</unittitle><unitid>UA005.010.084.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Malone, Taylor J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_37cc05fa79b6718f7e97ab2a654e8b3c">Epilepsy is a disease that is characterized by increased neural activity resulting in recurrent seizures. The development of epilepsy occurs during a period of gradual brain alterations called epileptogenesis, which can result from a precipitating event such as head trauma or an initial seizure event called status epilepticus (SE) or it can occur naturally due to genetic predisposition. Our lab previously identified a correlation between epileptogenesis after
                                chemically induced SE and increased Wnt signaling in the hippocampus, a primary region implicated in temporal lobe epilepsies. The additional observation that expression of HBP1, a Wnt repressor, decreased during this period led us to hypothesize that HBP1 may be a causal agent in epileptogenesis. A literature search revealed a gene block containing HBP1 and eight other genes that when deleted was significantly correlated with increased chance of developing
                                seizures. We created an HBP1 knockout strain of mice, compared its phenotype to that of the clinical patients, and found that the mouse model preserved the increased seizure susceptibility, incomplete penetrance, and development of spontaneous seizures. This data suggests that an HBP1 deletion might be the cause of seizures in these patients. To test if this model could be extended further, we looked at the molecular pathways altered in the knockout mice and found
                                that both the mTor and Wnt signaling pathways were upregulated, which is consistent with alterations observed during epileptogenesis in models of temporal lobe epilepsies. If further investigation reveals that this model is in fact a more general model for epilepsy, it can be used to aid in both the treatment and diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsies.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_88905d3bdcd72c510cc08af5fb612adc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In addition, salinity has been decreasing in high latitudes and is expected to continue decreasing due to altered precipitation patterns and glacial melting caused by climate change. Many marine organisms that are adapted to the present conditions may be drastically affected by these oceanic changes. Early life stages will be especially
                                susceptible, since they do not yet have fully developed adult defenses. In this study, we investigated the effects of reduced salinity (20 psu and 30 psu control) and altered temperature (15, 20, 25, and 29"C) on the growth, percent inorganic content (representing calcification), and feeding rates of juveniles and larvae of the invasive snail Crepidula fornicata. Both larval and juvenile growth rates were significantly depressed by low salinity and elevated by
                                higher temperatures. The salinity that snails were exposed to as larvae significantly impacted juvenile growth rates in 4 out of 6 experiments, an example of latent effects, but the magnitude and direction of this effect depended on temperature and parentage. In addition, juvenile feeding rates were significantly depressed in low salinity but there was little change in percent inorganic content. Larval percent inorganic content at 20"C was 27% lower in 20 than in
                                30 psu. In conclusion, C. fornicata may experience more favorable conditions in a warmer future: growth rates will increase, probably making juveniles more resistant to predation. However, in regions where salinity is decreasing, C. fornicata juveniles will grow and feed more slowly, thereby increasing predation risk by forcing them to spend more time at more vulnerable smaller sizes. Thus, the future of C. fornicata and their potential to continue invading will
                                depend on the specific salinity and temperature conditions they are exposed to during larval and juvenile development.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4d2212118a1891cadd70add0c958a3e6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The D. melanogaster homologue of Pol _ is encoded by mus308 and contains two domains, an N-terminal helicase-like domain and a C-terminal polymerase domain, connected by a central, non-conserved linker region. Unlike human Pol _ mutants, which are extremely radiosensitive, D. melanogaster mus308 mutants demonstrate extreme
                                sensitivity to interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agents, such as nitrogen mustard (HN2), but are not radiosensitive. In order to investigate the domain-specific functions of Pol _ during ICL repair, we generated a host of Pol _ domain-specific mutants. Our HN2 sensitivity studies with ATPase-dead and polymerase-dead transgenic flies have demonstrated that the helicase-like domain of Pol _ is essential for the repair of HN2 induced ICLs while polymerase-dead flies
                                were only moderately sensitive to ICL agents. Flies which express truncated Pol _ protein expressing part of the linker region and either only the N-terminus or C-terminus are equally extremely sensitive to HN2. These suggests that the C-terminus of Pol _ could have some function in recruitment of other proteins to ICLs outside of its catalytic function. It has been shown that the sensitivity to HN2 is partially rescued in flies which express the N- and C-termini
                                of the protein in trans, suggesting that there is not an absolute requirement that the two catalytic domains be part of the same polypeptide. Our data support a model in which the helicase-like domain of Pol _ functions upstream of the polymerase domain and is crucial for repair of HN2 induced ICLs. Furthermore, we propose that the presence, but not the catalytic function, of the polymerase domain is also required for proper repair of ICLs.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4e8b126df68bc1b38f99af1a56731cd1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

By restricting movement across the landscape, habitat fragmentation can disrupt biological processes and threaten long-term population persistence. In the Hawaiian Islands, habitat loss and fragmentation have contributed to a high rate of avian species loss. Bird movement between wetlands is important for maintaining local populations. Habitat
                                connectivity measures the ability of an animal in one habitat patch to reach other patches, and depends partly on "landscape resistance," or the degree to which the landscape reduces the likelihood of movement between habitat patches. This study related observed inter-wetland movement patterns of Hawaiian stilts on Oahu to characteristics of the inter-wetland landscape in order to determine which characteristics impede bird movement. I hypothesized different
                                levels of resistance for each of 4 landscape variables. I developed 4 models based on Euclidean distance and 108 models based on the 4 landscape features. For each hypothesis the landscape of Oahu was modeled as a GIS resistance surface. Each surface was evaluated to produce expected resistance distances between pairwise combinations of 10 wetlands on Oahu at which stilts were resighted. Expected resistance distances were compared to observed resistance distances
                                derived from stilt resighting data. Elevation and landcover were the most influential landscape variables. Model explanatory power increased as the predicted resistance due to elevation increased. Both Euclidean distance and landscape variable models explained a significant amount of the variation in observed movement frequency among wetland pairs where movement was observed. Neither type of models predicted whether stilt movement occurred between wetlands.
                                Occurrence or lack of movement may be influenced more by attributes of the wetlands themselves than by characteristics of the intervening landscape.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bbfb896209b21fca3e4fb69ecf685d9a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Neurons send and receive signals at synapses located at the terminus of axons and at various points throughout the dendritic arbor, and those signals are then transmitted through the dendrites and axons. Because most proteins are synthesized in the cell body, proper synaptic transmission requires the transport of hundreds of proteins and membrane bound
                                vesicles from the cell body to the synapses and vice versa. Fluctuation in cellular activity requires continuous production and degradation of proteins, resulting in highly dynamic synaptic protein and vesicle concentrations. One example of a protein whose concentration is closely regulated at the synapse is the glutamate neurotransmitter receptor. This receptor is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, processed in the Golgi complex, and transported from the
                                cell body to be integrated into the synaptic plasma membrane. Conversely, once a receptor is targeted for degradation, it is internalized into endosomes, carried to multi-vesicular bodies, and ultimately degraded by lysosomes. Oftentimes, proteins and vesicles must travel large distances (up to one meter in humans) from the cell body to the synapses. Much remains to be learned about these processes, and in my project I focus on how organelles critical for synapse
                                function are distributed and trafficked in neurons. I do so by examining the distribution of organelles involved in the glutamate receptor trafficking pathway and by identifying the role of the kinesin motor KLP-4 in trafficking these organelles.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1e17c85f7c51d1f8761bed53fb9f7a9f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The aim of this study was to characterize the release of these cytokines from HMC-1 human mast cells. Positive control stimulation of both of these mediators was established through the use of the calcium ionophore A23187 and PMA. It was shown that the neuropeptides neurotensin and substance P, for which mast cells have
                                functional receptors, do not induce the release of these cytokines. The mechanism of release of these cytokines was subject to investigation, namely, whether these cytokines are pre-formed and stored in granules until their release, similarly to histamine, or whether they are synthesized de novo upon stimulation. This mechanism is currently unknown, but evidence from these experiments suggests that they are synthesized de novo, because peak cytokine release was
                                observed more than 3 hours after stimulation. Further studies into intracellular cytokine mRNA levels and intracellular cytokine levels were attempted, and would be continued in the future. These studies would allow a more complete understanding of the release process and potentially offer support to the current theory that cytokines are synthesized de novo.

Additionally, decreases in HBP1 have been associated with a shift in carbon metabolism, termed the Warburg effect, which is commonly found in cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized
                                that in addition to regulating Wnt signaling, changes in HBP1 levels may also be responsible for the altered carbon metabolism exhibited by cancer cells. Using MDA-MB-231 cells, a human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) line, we examined the biochemical effects of HBP1 overexpression through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Then, we performed further in vivo experiments using IS13 TNBC cells, in which we examined the efficacy of EGCG/Decitabine (DAC)
                                treatment, a method known to induce HBP1. In both cases, in vivo experiments were performed by orthotopically implanting NOD/SCID mice with TNBC cells. We hypothesized that both HBP1 overexpression and EGCG/DAC treatment would result in reduction of Wnt signaling and Warburg effect enzymes in the treated tumors. The Western blot and qRT-PCR data for both experiments, along with 1H-NMR data for the EGCG/DAC experiments, indicate that both HBP1 overexpression and
                                EGCG/DAC treatment result in metabolic shifts away from the Warburg effect, and that EGCG/DAC can directly suppress growth of TNBC tumors.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2ffd32c7cf5bc628eddb342219b98898"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Exotic invasives negatively impact community structure, although the degree to which they do this is poorly understood for recent introductions. It is therefore essential to elucidate the role that invaders play in new ecological communities. Ecological modeling can be used to form testable predictions of the impact of exotic invasives. The European
                                paper wasp, Polistes dominulus, was first found in Eastern Massachusetts in the mid 1970s, and has since established populations across the United States. P. dominulus and its native congener, P. fuscatus, primarily rear brood on lepidopteran larvae, putting the two wasp species in competition and their shared prey species under increased predation pressure. We constructed an individual-based model of wasp foraging and nesting behavior to predict the impact of P.
                                dominulus predation on lepidopteran prey populations. Our model uses location-specific weather data and local demographic data on P. dominulus nest growth, along with published data on foraging and nest building in Polistes wasps, to make targeted predictions of the number of lepidopteran larvae killed by individual P. dominulus nests in invaded communities. Fitting a linear regression model to our model output provided us with an equation that can be used to
                                estimate the amount of caterpillar prey consumed by P. dominulus nests in Eastern Massachusetts. These predictions can be combined with information on P. dominulus nest density and prey preference to better identify how much prey is being consumed in a given area, and which prey species are most at risk from invasive wasp predation. Ultimately, our model serves as a foundation upon which we will continue to build a more generalizable model to predict the impact of

Sequencing of the RPO21 locus from 36 wild strains of budding yeast uncovered many polymorphisms that resulted in different lengths of its essential C-terminal domain (CTD) repeat. An alignment of the newly found variants demonstrated that over evolutionary time, there have been many expansions and contractions to the CTD resulting in the variety of alleles seen today. With this surprising finding of variability in an essential domain, it became important to find factors that could contribute to this observed variation. From analyzing the nucleotide sequence of RPO21, it was found that a G-quadruplex could form at the most C-terminal repeats of the CTD. Additionally this nucleotide region of the CTD has been found to be bound b ythe G4 speicifc helicas PIF1 by
                previous chromatin immunoprecipitation studies,. Using the tTa-dependent expression system developed in the Fuchs Lab with a pif1-m2 mutant in a Luria-Delbr�ck fluctuation assay, it was found that PIF1 acts an inhibitor of expansion events in the CTD. This finding led to a larger survey of the yeast genome for other minisatellites that may behave like the CTD due to the presence of PIF1 binding as well as the possibility to form a G4. This analysis ultimately found that three key transcriptional enzymes SPT5, GAL11, and RPO21 all have G4 sequences in their variable minisatellites. However, future examination is required to understand why these three repeats demonstrate polymorphisms while other similar repeats do not.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

When activated by the endogenous peptide ligand chemerin, CMKLR1 triggers a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels via coupling with the inhibitory G protein G�i. The physiological implications of CMKLR1 activation remain unclear. We previously outlined the development of a soluble proteolysis-resistant chemerin peptide (s-sChem), and the corresponding membrane-anchored compound (l-sChem). The latter displayed anti-inflammatory effects in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. Understanding the mechanism by which it exerts this effect is critical for the development of therapeutics targeting CMKLR1 in humans. In this report, we describe the development of a forskolin stimulation-based assay for exploring the functional implications of chronic incubation with l-sChem on CMKLR1 signaling. Pretreatment with l-sChem decreases CMKLR1-mediated signaling in this
                assay, whereas s-sChem does not. Additionally, we show that l-sChem inhibits signaling of other G�i-coupled receptors, and that this effect is mediated by CMKLR1. Finally, preliminary ELISA data suggest that the difference between s-sChem and l-sChem treatment are not due to differences in CMKLR1 expression. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the functional antagonism of CMKLR1 by l-sChem is mediated by phosphorylation of the receptor.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

FRA16D, located within the tumor suppressor gene WWOX, is the second most highly expressed CFS in humans and has been associated with a variety of cancer cell lines. It is our hypothesis that multiple sequences within FRA16D work in a concerted effort to cause expression of the CFS. The first goal of this project was to assess these cis factors through a subtractive approach, using a YAC breakage assay designed to correlate the number of FOAR colonies to the rate of breakage. Deleting F1 and F5, two sequences containing AT repeats, caused a significant decrease in breakage, while deleting P5P5b, a region expected to form two large cruciforms (one of which is AT-rich), did not yield a change in fragility. In contrast, an additive approach was taken to measure the fragility of the F5 region via a direct duplication recombination assay (DDRA). The
                introduction of F5 with 24 interrupted AT repeats did not yield an increase in breakage, while the introduction of F1 with 23 perfect AT repeats had previously been shown to cause fragility. Taking findings from both approaches suggests that F5 might only cause breakage in the context of FRA16D, acting as a kind of 'enabler' in the region. Trans factors affecting breakage were also tested via the DDRA in yeast strains containing a specific cassette with the 34 (AT) repeats of the F1 sequence. The deletion of MUS81 showed a very significant decrease in the rate of FOAR compared to the wild type, a result congruent with Mus81's role as an endonuclease that causes breaks at CFSs. The deletion of MEC1, an ATR homolog, yielded an increase in FOAR that was milder than expected, based on the well-documented effect of ATR kinases in preventing fragility. This result was explained by finding that MEC1 was not actually deleted and was perhaps being preserved as an
                extrachromosomal element.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

However, organisms can employ a number of strategies in preventing genomic instability. Previous data in our lab suggests that acetylation of lysine residues H4-K12 and H4-K16 at CAG repeats is important in marking the DNA for repair, but the exact molecular mechanism of how these modifications affected repair fidelity remained unknown. This thesis explores the action of chromatin remodelers, hypothesized to be directly recruited to the acetylated residues through their bromodomain protein motif. Our data support that recruitment of the bromodomain-containing remodeling proteins Rsc2 and Bdf1 by the acetylation of H4-K16 facilitates DNA repair through a post-replicative repair pathway via gap-induced sister chromatid recombination (SCR). Additional evidence presented here identifies that this feature is unique to histone H4, and
                that CAG repeat maintenance is not affected by the acetylation state of other histone residues. By contributing data from this thesis with previous work in our lab, a novel model of dynamic H4 acetylation leading to high-fidelity DNA repair at CAG repeats has been elucidated.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In this study a sex-linked candidate ecological speciation gene, Pdd, was located by linkage mapping and Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping. Linkage maps were constructed for four univoltine Z-strain (UZ) and bivoltine Z-strain (BZ) backcross families by genotyping polymorphic markers using gel electrophoresis, Sanger sequencing, or Sequenom genotyping assay. This is the most dense linkage map of the ECB sex- chromosome to map within a region previously found to be inverted between ECB pheromone strains (Wadsworth et al., 2014). Linkage maps reveal substantial rearrangement (more than half the linkage map) of gene order relative to Bombyx mori (the silk worm) including at least two inverted regions. A consensus QTL map including
                genotypes from twelve families was also analyzed for the location of a single QTL (estimation of a 95% Bayesian credible interval) and assessed for the likelihood of multiple interacting QTLs. Significant additive QTL interactions were detected when the existence of two QTLs was assumed (p &lt; 0.05). This is the first evidence that the genetic basis of PDD, a trait responsible for as much as 85% reproductive isolation between pheromone strains (Dopman et al., 2010), is polygenic. Investigation of strong, pre- zygotic reproductive isolating barriers between incipient species can provide important information about the origins of the speciation process, particularly at the genetic and genomic levels, for populations living sympatrically.</scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

One potential therapeutic target for the treatment or prevention of nematode infections is chitin deacetylase (CDA). CDA converts the biologically important carbohydrate polymer of chitin (beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine) to chitosan. The effectiveness of this process has been correlated to healthy nematode development. The aim of this study was to generate soluble, purified, and active CDA for further characterization through various activity assays. Variations on a bacterial expression system were constructed using the pET22b and pGEX-4T-2 bacterial vectors and the Caenorhabditis elegans CDA gene F48E3.8c. Host cell cultures carrying distinct versions of the recombinant plasmids were extracted using a variety of induction and lysis conditions. Expression of soluble CDA was accomplished using the full F48E3.8c gene, as well as a truncated version of
                the gene. Enzymatic activity was successfully restored following the denaturation and crude purification of CDA embedded in polyacrylamide gels. Further experiments are required to optimize the purification of active protein in solution.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tufts University.

markets has focused primarily on why customers choose to shop at farmers' markets.  This thesis takes a broader view, exploring farmers' markets as multi-dimensional social spaces shaped not only by food procurement needs, but by elaborate social and political meanings attached to food and to consumption itself.  Using ethnographic fieldwork and 22 in-depth interviews with consumers and vendors, this research shows how these meanings are constructed and resisted collaboratively by shoppers and vendors, and the powerful ways in which they are informed by leading voices in the New Food Movement.  In particular, I show that shoppers consume ideals promoted by the New Food movement, despite their perceptions of themselves as unaffiliated - and in some cases opposed - to the movement itself.  Although farmers benefit from the wholesome halo afforded them by the New Food Movement, in the end, bucolic valorization comes with considerable costs in the form of unrealistic consumer expectations and pressure to somehow be above the realities of profit-based necessities.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_39208de94d1df58ef3932a0bb85db362"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Sociology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_25b14f9216f1527f4dda6a140095e74d" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Experiences and Attributes of Low-Income Students at Tufts University</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.025.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sadowski, Katherine Taylor</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7a4b8cc9b023600726d8ffd12350dd33">This paper focuses on the experiences of eight low-income students at an elite university and the personal characteristics they use to approach their undergraduate educations. I explore their educational backgrounds in order to explain the ways in which they adapt to the environment that is distinct to an elite university, in this case Tufts. I argue that their values are consistent with the values of the student body as a whole and they indicate a strong sense of belonging, thus they interpret their experiences as positive. My analysis includes an investigation of students' attributes and experiences that mitigate the negative influences imposed by their limited economic capital. While students perceive their experiences as positive, I call attention to their complex interpretations of the influence of social class on campus and suggest that they still face significant financial limitations that put them at a disadvantage as compared to other students. The challenges resulting from their low-income status also creates a social distance between them and the higher-income students, which they claim is unnoticed by their peers. Though low-income students appear to be successful in this elite environment, their experiences are defined by personal cycles of struggle and mitigation, which contribute to their overwhelmingly self-aware experiences.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d79f9304d10d9f5ca3f6f492d9d9b9f2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Sociology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3ac77bf3f4c3ae32550b182dbe3b9db1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Out of Modernity: The Search for Identity in Study Abroad and Performance of Identity in Cultural Tourism</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.026.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Eaton, Jacob Copeland</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_700f8123db1b2cee4838ccface17b346">This paper explores the boundaries of anthropology, edu-tourism and study abroad.

It goes on to explore how the performance of identity in East African cultural tourism, despite adhering to the tourist gaze of Western thought, allows indigenous tribes with cultural, political and economic autonomy. The first chapter surveys the anthropological thought on tourism and provides a background of tourism in Kenya and Tanzania. The second chapter looks at the growing field of Maasai tourism in Kenya. The third chapter examines the issue of land rights for the hunter-gatherer Hadzabe of Tanzania and how tourism allows the group a measure of control over their land.

Although friendship has been shown to be an undervalued relationship in comparison to the historically and politically dominant institutions of marriage and family, during this period of relationship transformation, friendship has become an increasingly salient alternative resource of support and stability to individuals facing multiple relationship transitions over the life course. This thesis offers a qualitative investigation of the value of friendship for study participants in the context of other relationships. My results are based on 16 in-depth semi-structured interviews with 8 male and 8 female heterosexual participants aged 24-38 years residing in the Boston area. Participants described a diversity of practices and preferences for intimacy in relationships. In order to establish intimacy in the ambiguous relationship of friendship, they had to navigate intimacy throughout the process of creating and maintaining a highly individualized relationship. The voluntary investment in friendship "not compelled or obligated by collective bonds" resulted in enhanced social validation, described by participants as unique to the relationship of friendship. My findings demonstrate that friendship is more complex than has previously been shown. I also found that when friendship was a recognized bond in other kinship relationships, or acted as a supplementary resource to kinship relations, it produced enhanced benefits of support for well-being over the life course.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7fbf99a0ce837774737a24dca703dbd2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Marriage</subject><subject source="local">Manners and customs</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_76e8036615249bebe7eb95e18a32a0d0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Who Supports Community Supported Agriculture?: Re-Examining Exchange Relationships within Community Supported Agriculture and Commodity Capitalism</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.030.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Porteshawver, Signe R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_254691c1831af97bcd6d5c7d5aa5e511">Using fieldwork from participant observation research at three Northeastern community supported agriculture farms, this thesis argues that personal relationships of exchange and relationships of mutual dependence make up community and can propel the CSA movement.

Drawing on West and Zimmerman's pivotal work on doing gender (1987), this research seeks to fill this gap.  Drawing on fieldwork and qualitative interviews with members of a regional U-18 softball team and a high school varsity basketball team over the course of their season, I show that there are a variety of ways in which adolescent female athletes manage being a girl and being an athlete.  Through their actions, the athletes I observed were redefining what it meant to be a girl by being an athlete at the same time.  Sometimes, they separated their gendered performances into different contexts.  Other times, gender was just not a salient performance.  Most importantly, some of the athletes blended aspects of a normatively feminine gender performance with aspects of being an athlete to create a new gendered category of female athlete.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1ba3541787befefc9b2dae02f6f8f658"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Women athletes--Psychology</subject><subject source="local">Gender Identity</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a74b988bb0204386785510c43d42f1e2" level="item"><did><unittitle>An Analysis of the Pharaoh Akhenaten's Religious and Philosophical Revolution</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.032.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Taronas, Laura E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cdba17a97747d3db5a39d7d191f2c732">Akhenaten came to power as the pharaoh of Egypt in either the year 1353 or 1351 BCE and reigned for roughly seventeen years.  He ascended to the throne under his birth name, Amenhotep IV, but in year five of his rule the king chose to change his name to one that better reflected his philosophical ideas for which he is now best known.  Shortly after this first bold step Akhenaten initiated a series of unprecedented changes in the spheres of Egyptian religion, art, writing, and architecture.  Each of these groundbreaking innovations was closely tied to the new natural philosophy that the king espoused and was intended to replace traditional Egyptian religion.  Akhenaten centered his new philosophy on the minor sun god, the Aten, whose existence was first recorded during the 12th Dynasty (1991-1778 BCE). It is the aim of this thesis to understand the nature of Akhenaten_�_s innovations within Egyptian religion, to characterize the specific belief structure of Atenism, and to recognize the pharaoh_�_s motivation for enacting such upheaval.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5fc92f6b8e86201ba90b9627572567cf"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_61ac60333aaacac1615d538611645f5b" level="item"><did><unittitle>No Art, No Point: Selling and asserting artistic identity in a commodified urban space</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.033.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Connors, Amy Elizabeth</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e4536022a23ef8d38f2dfe2cb933a2ad">Authenticity and legitimacy are complex issues for a community of artists, especially in the context of gentrification.  In an effort to understand the relationship between artistic identity and commodified redevelopment, this paper examines the identity narrative of Boston_�_s Fort Point Arts Community from its initial golden age through its subsequent decline and current struggle with branded gentrification.  Through 15 interviews and 10 fieldwork visits, this thesis finds that artists initially resisted gentrification as a contaminating symbol and an extension of society_�_s devaluation of artists.  I argue, however, that the field of gentrification_��and its emphasis on rhetoric and appropriation_��have compelled Fort Point_�_s artists to reorient their notion of artist in order to enact a more strategic identity.  Through this more deliberately marketable identity concept, Fort Point_�_s artists reconceptualize themselves as potential partners in the construction of an urban brand.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_624be6af95d0f3da3e9e773382fa4e01"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_f3c3c855d9b4f5e34a973a665163f03c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Wait, does that have Peanuts?

Using qualitative data from ethnographic observations and twenty semi-structured in depth interviews, this study examines how perceived stigma shapes how individuals understand, interpret and present their own allergy to others, and how this varies by gender.  Findings indicate that food allergies require a delicate balance of the desire for social normalcy and asking for or demanding accommodation.  Individuals develop coping strategies to maintain this balance and avoid the negative social ramifications of asking for accommodations to their food allergy.  These strategies shape how they present their allergies to others, and their level of comfort in social situations where food is present.  Moreover these coping mechanisms are molded by gender.  Gendered perception of eating, conceptions of masculinity and femininity and gendered differences in asking for accommodation play out as individuals manage, interpret and present their allergy.  People with food allergies decide whether to explicitly state their allergy and request accommodation for it or deemphasize their allergy or even hide it based on their relationship with the person or institution they are interacting with.  Individuals aim to find the _��best_�� balance between attaining safe, allergen-free food and social comfort in the context of gendered expectations of what it means to refuse food or ask other people to accommodate specialized needs.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_54fcd19d0ab1facde440aeedc801e653"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_50f2612e8997c698c4554cc4172063ff" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Role of Maize in Forming and Maintaining Community in Arroyo Sacasiguan, Guatemala</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.035.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">deBeausset, Sasha Mae</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_25fa004610d3323551c2e63c32e400ec">Maize is the staple of Guatemalan diet.

I do this through an analysis of asram, both a classification and a diagnosis of potentially fatal newborn illnesses.  The research was conducted in the Summers of 2010 and 2011 through interviews, group discussions, and participant observation in the village of Osiem, in the Eastern Region of Ghana.  I examine how the basis of biomedical knowledge reconstructs a person into that which is appropriate to the medical gaze by classifying illness as _��naturally occurring_��.   This knowledge is limited to those trained in the biomedical field, and subsequently reduces or excludes the participation of others on the basis of their access, or lack thereof, to this knowledge.  I compare biomedical knowledge and practice with an analysis of the concepts of personhood in Akan-speaking communities of Osiem.  Here, health and wellbeing are shared responsibilities among every member of society.  These responsibilities call for a different type of participation from a mother in response to asram than that found in medical practice at the Hawa Memorial Saviour Hospital.  Through an analysis of infant head massaging, I posit that the biomedical and local basis of knowledge occupy different contexts of authority, that of the hospital and that of the home.  These contexts of authority provide the means through which mothers can negotiate between local and biomedical practices in regards to their newborns health.  This negotiation creates a gradient of knowledge that reveals that asram can be integrated within both the local and biomedical contexts.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9d3886c128922285c00deefbe2cab678"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_a3e273e6bc41a5770b9631c054b22416" level="item"><did><unittitle>Jewish Jumbos: A Community Segregated From Within</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.037.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Linder, Ilana Lauren</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ef4ce552cc64dcb7816d30ee1fd3fd88">When students leave home and move to college, they gain a great deal of freedom in deciding what shape their individual lives will take, what interests they will pursue, and which aspects of their pre-college lives they will abandon. One such decision students must make is whether or not to embrace their religion once they escape the realm of overbearing parents and gain full-control over their daily activities. It is the intent of this research project to use both quantitative and qualitative methods in speaking with ten diverse undergraduates to take a closer look at how a specific group of undergraduates go about making the choice of whether or not to become involved with their religion on their own while away for college. In particular, the seeming discrepancy that exists between identifying oneself with a macro-level (broad') Jewish community and claiming membership in the micro-level (University') Jewish community is explored. In attempting to explain this differentiation, predictors of group-identification for each level' will be considered, both independently as well as cohesively. Furthermore, it will be revealed that the Jewish student population at this university is one that continuously perpetuates segregation from within itself.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c710879d7032ae78a97e384e15a8b68f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Sociology/Anthropology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d19a3a56a29f7a97a2bc2e80d8ae83c1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Limits of Consumer Activism</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.038.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kim, Elaine M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7765987c31ddca9706754c310f0b11e4">Drawing on literature about consumerism and social movements, this article aims to explore the characteristics of a consumer society and the intersection of consumerism and activism. I then present four hypotheses that describe potential limitations of consumer activism. The first is that for consumption-based forms of activism, who can and cannot participate is heavily dependent on the individual's amount of economic capital. The second is that politicized consumption is not a gateway into deeper involvement, but rather encourages superficial, temporary participation. The third is that the conditions needed for action become synchronized with those necessary for purchase, and thus individuals come to only support initiatives that can deliver quantifiable, measurable change. The last hypothesis is that what methods are perceived as an effective way to create social change becomes heavily limited. These hypotheses are tested in a case study of the Fair Trade Movement, based on in-depth interviews of participants in the Greater Boston area.

The second includes a wider variety of voicesparticipants, analysts, and theorists of the movementin expounding upon what the Occupy encampments were like on a day-to-day basis and the meaning(s) they offered to their multiple constituents.  Chapter Three explores the movement's inherent intersectionality and capacity to bring together many issue-focused activists and networks.  Grounding this discussion in my own background in food system activism, I use an extended case study of the relationship between the Occupy and food movements to demonstrate one such convergence, examining how these two movements have shared ideological, tactical, and even physical space.  Finally, the last chapter offers an analytical reflection in which I look to my own life and surrounding environment in an effort to understand where and how we continue to see Occupy's ripple effects.  Throughout all four chapters, I challenge the commonly held criticism that Occupy lacked important outcomes.  While acknowledging Occupy's intrinsic complexities and tensions, I offer a more sympathetic understanding of the movement that deems its process-oriented approach a significant outcome in and of itself.  I explore multiple discourses within and surrounding the Occupy and food movements in order to make broader statements about the value of liminal spaces, performative protest, and intersectional activism.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_331924731e39984597f26d473793d31b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Sociology/Anthropology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_111a32ef084d9e8ab03d86063ce74219" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Hope of the Indian: Mining Agriculture and Indigenismo in Peru's Central Highlands</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.040.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Powell, Stephanie M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8ebe7e3b19c4990faec3b8d4d2aa0b65">This study traces the development of mining in the central highlands of Peru and its intersection with literary, social, and political movements. Silver mining contributed greatly to Peru's economic growth during the colonial period and throughout the nineteenth century, and indigenous peasants provided the majority of seasonal labor to the mines. Peru's defeat in the War of the Pacific resulted in the beginnings of indigenismo, exemplified by the writings of Manuel Gonzlez Prada. The Cerro de Pasco Corporation, the largest foreign-owned mining operation in the twentieth-century, impacted the indigenous population, internal economy, and environment of the central highlands. Indigenista Dora Mayer provides the most detailed account of company abuses and the reactions and resistance efforts of peasant-miners. Literary and political indigenismo provide the context for the transitioning identities of peasant-miners and the 1928 Morococha mine disaster and its repercussions. Historical patterns of institutionalized inequality are evident throughout this thesis, and mining emerges as the convergence of larger concerns about modernization, race, and imperialism.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_eeaaa5f733820c3311f45b861e690dd3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Sociology/Anthropology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9dd1506cf9167199f8239d6cdab12889" level="item"><did><unittitle>Comparing the "De-Othering" of Immigrants in American and British Popular Television</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.041.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cullinane, Caroline A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_12fdf9524bd929d8caa0be6e31fe2487">The topics of immigration, immigrants, and immigration policy have dominated political and journalistic rhetoric in the United States and United Kingdom in recent decades.  The debate has profoundly influenced popular culture in each country, where entertainment media is used to vocalize concerns about a consistent and sustained influx of non-Western immigrants to both countries.  Representations of non-Western immigrants in American and British television specifically designate the communities and individuals shown as a non-Western other, culturally separate in the context of the programs from American and British society.  By subscribing to each country's respective values system for recent immigrants (i.e. the American Dream and its British equivalent), immigrant television characters are able to shed their status as other and become cultural citizens of their respective countries.  By focusing on British adaptations of American television and vice versa, this thesis explores the specific cultural differences in the adapted television programs that temper this de-othering process in popular culture and how they reflect the overall differences between the cultural values systems for immigrants in each country.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e897974277ca2a3c2e5d3d2fbbaf6f5b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Sociology/Anthropology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fa15899958c1df678f1bd980f121420b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Defining Local, Defining Fruit: Understanding Place and Identity Through Dragon Fruit and Tomatoes</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.042.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Humiston, Mae M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_eb94f056a9ec233806bce5277a45c7ef">This thesis asks how human and non-human speciesin this case, two kinds of fruitintersect in politics, economics, formations of categories, and conceptions of scales and identities. I draw on theory about consumer and material culture, place-making, and interspecies relationships to produce an in-depth reading of tomatoes and dragon fruit that reveals their deep interconnections with the human world.  I describe my theoretical framework and methods in the first chapter of the thesis. I also discuss how my own exploration of these fruits involved border crossings and transformations of fruits and the ideas associated with them. These two specific fruit, both native to Central and South America, are useful to investigate the mediation of identities, scales, and contexts because they are simultaneously globalized and localized in notable ways.  Chapter Two traces the history of tomatoes through colonization and industrial capitalism, showing how this fruit played a central part in the development of industrialized food processing and fast food marketing and how it has become American.  The chapter also explores how tomatoes have found a place in contemporary alternatives to the dominant food system, including their role in local food activism and farmworkers' rights campaigns.  In a similar feat of flexibility, the dragon fruit has successfully established itself as Vietnamese, as I show in Chapter Three. Although brought to Vietnam by French colonizers, it has become a mode of Vietnamese empowerment and assertion of national identity in the face of foreign domination, notably in relation to Chinese hegemony and global capitalism. Dragon fruit in Vietnam are full of histories of colonialist domination, but are mobilized as tools for Vietnamese empowerment and entry into the global market. In my final chapter, I describe my experience marching with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers for better working conditions for migrant farmworkers in Florida. This concluding chapter demonstrates the messy, contradictory, and polyvocal ideas that fruit carries and communicates and how my ideas and my self are implicated in this messiness. As these fruit both cross and shape boundaries and borders, people use them to understand and mediate changing spaces, places, economies, and identities, including our own.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2f96d105cfcae98e33569ff3f29cd2bf"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Sociology/Anthropology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c841775d259a57dd9bbfa85fb0a00809" level="item"><did><unittitle>Embodying Resistance: An Analysis of Authority Over Sex and Gender in the Trans Identity</unittitle><unitid>UA005.011.044.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Clark, Bryn M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_626c6bc269a96f1ed3e02e32c85b037e">This paper looks beyond the medical narrative of transgender and gender nonconforming identities and demonstrates how members of the trans community define sex and gender through their own lived experiences.

Throughout,

In recent years, mass-media outlets such as the Food Network have turned chefs into celebrities. Central to this trend has been the rise of competitive cooking shows, like Iron Chef America and Chopped, where chefs duel with one another in pseudo-athletic settings. These outlets have made a long-standing
                                relationship, dating back to the French creation of professional cooking, even more explicit: food, cuisine, and identity are necessarily linked. In this context, where lines between self and food are increasingly unclear, the figure of the lesbian chef is being created, represented, and circulated to an ever-expanding audience. Among the many possible expressions of queerness, these venues are selecting a few token images as exchangeable signs of lesbianism in
                                the market.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_33c85ecc026ebd645fd006b68eeecc99"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

During ten weeks of ethnographic fieldwork at the market in 2013, I attempted to understand the gap between popular discourse and reality when it came to 'danger' at Camal. Drawing on anthropological theories about the informal economy, globalization, and insecurity, this thesis proposes that concerns about danger reflect more complicated perceptions of race and modernity that are being given a new gloss as Ecuador becomes more involved in globalized capitalism. Chapter One sketches the history of Ecuador from the pre-Colombian era to the present, with a particular focus on how imaginaries of race and modernity have shaped the nation. Chapter Two is a spatial exploration of Quito's markets and the city's distinctive North-South geographic orientation, showing how notions of race have
                influenced the placement and perception of markets. In Chapter Three, I examine discourse about the market and argue that many Quite�os fear Camal's clearly hybridized form of exchange and relatively undisciplined space, which challenge seemingly stable racialized categories in a city felt to be insecure in general. Chapter Four is dedicated to the vendors' behaviors and their own stories about the market. Using as a starting-point anthropologist Cindi Katz's categories of resilience, reworking, and resistance, the chapter shows how the global and the local produce one another on many levels, while simultaneously creating 'excesses' that cannot fully be captured through any single analytical lens. I conclude with a brief discussion of positionality and a rationale for producing ethnographic knowledge even in the absence of definitive conclusions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Quito (Ecuador)--Social conditions.</geogname><geogname source="local">Quito (Ecuador)--History.</geogname><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Catalysts could allow combustion at lower temperatures than catalyst-free fuels and can assist in both the oxidation and dehydrogenation steps. N-hexane oxidation was used as a surrogate for jet fuel combustion. The catalyst was also studied in the solid phase, rather than dispersed in the fuel.  Co3O4, Fe2O3, and Fe2O3 doped with Co3O4 nanocrystals were prepared hydrothermally in an oleic acid/ethanol/oleylamine system. The resulting particle size was 3-20 nm in solution depending on the preparation method. The nanocrystals were used as oxidation catalysts for n-hexane. Real-time NDIR analysis monitored the CO2 evolution and reaction progress.  Pure Co3O4 nanocrystals showed the highest activity of all of the samples tested. Activity began at 250&amp;#x00B0; C and was reached complete combustion by 300&amp;#x00B0; C. Activity at multiple temperatures with low conversion was measured to determine the apparent activation energy (k=A*e-Ea/(RT)), 114 kJ/mol. The solubility of Co3O4 nanocrystals in liquid hexane was found to be 2 mg/mL by gravimetric analysis. The Co3O4 nanocrystals have sufficient solubility to be dispersed in hexane at catalytic concentrations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2d7cf71fcebda1ef52d9553644886c70"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_69208ca58491a4b82e4aadd62bed70ee" level="item"><did><unittitle>Design of Dynamic Experiments to Optimize Batch Processes</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.006.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Marvin, William</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_be5fe8a01be13f9bd91eeafd916f9784">Design of Dynamic Experiments to Optimize Batch Processes</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_961774f27c1af4d56173894cf24ff400"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_05669240846a5a620f17ee2395d967f7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Preparation and Characterization of Gelatin and Chitosan Films</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Diop, Jeanette</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ff5904777db822d74617f6a7f7603a4c">This paper outlines the study of fabrication and characterization of gelatin and chitosan films with the goal of determining the optimal method of preparing these films in order to improve on their mechanical properties. Gelatin films were prepared by spin coating and casting on PDMS mold. Chitosan films were prepared by spin coating and drying known masses of samples in the fume hood or the oven. Films were stored in a vacuum chamber when not being tested. Each film was tensile tested for its Modulus of Elasticity, Tensile Strength, Yield Strength, and Elongation at Break. Tensile properties of films are affected by various innate properties of the film such as moisture content of the films, physicochemical properties of the films, humidity of the atmosphere during testing. The results of this project indicated that gelatin films prepared by casting were better suited for tensile testing. In order to minimize atmospheric effects, films must be stored in a vacuum box or dessicator until testing. Chitosan films that are washed with sodium hydroxide solution after drying were less susceptible to humidity; chitosan films prepared with acetic acid tend to be easier to handle during film preparation and testing.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5cc3006a5b68fa0a0976dddda5e4b906"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_442f4a9191f65ec6597bfdd4ce9b5b50" level="item"><did><unittitle>Self-Assembly of Functional Nanosurfaces and Complex Nanostructures with Genetically Modified Tobacco Mosaic Virus</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.008.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Horelik, Nicholas</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_95f9b6534b94c3e78b29bfa4d096a9f5">In this project I explored two different methods for utilizing genetically modified tobacco mosaic viruses (TMVs) to robustly create tunable and functional nano-scale surfaces and structures. As highly stable nano-scale rods, TMVs provide for excellent nanotemplates that are programmable via nucleic acid hybridization and functionalizable with genetically inserted thiol groups in cysteine residues.  Utilizing gold-thiol binding and functionalization with fluorescein, fluorescence and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results clearly demonstrate the capacity for TMVs to specifically and tunably self-assemble onto gold surfaces while retaining thiol functionality.  Utilizing the hybridization-based assembly of TMVs to DNA miniarrays, AFM results should also clearly demonstrate the capacity for TMVs to be selectively linked to form TMV dimers, trimers, and other arbitrarily complex geometries, although no conclusive results were obtained prior to the submission of this document.  Either of these two methods might find applications in producing better catalysts, providing more functionality to sensing surfaces, or lending strength or functionality to nano-scale devices.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7acb2a8af9fd97e08357304df561784d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_75ad708212dce37bc59b5408a4f440a1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Application of Design of Dynamic Experiments in a Batch Crystallizer</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.009.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hagger, Andrew</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a2bf264d2fec4e3041794cc841cac7d9">This project set out to control the sizes of crystals grown in a batch crystallizer using a technique called the Design of Dynamic Experiments (DoDE).

Current methods of removal either rely on activated charcoal absorption techniques, or use air stripping to force the volatile contaminants into the atmosphere where they are degraded. Both methods are costly and particularly wasteful. Thus, there is an urgent need for robust, inexpensive catalysts for hydrodechlorination reactions which could be used at the industrial scale. Recent investigations have demonstrated the effectiveness of nanoscale palladium at catalyzing the hydrodechlorination of similar contaminates, but cost and stability constraints have prevented their widespread use. This study investigates the catalytic properties of palladium nanoparticles reduced onto genetically modified Tobacco Mosaic Virus nanotemplates. The TMV were self-assembled into high surface area scaffolds on gold chips, and were then coated with palladium using aqueous palladium ions in a reducing sodium hypophosphite solution. The resulting chips were analyzed by atomic force microscopy to determine the surface topology. The chips were placed in a hydrodechlorination reactor with a dilute 2-chlorophenol solution and a constant hydrogen sparge, and the products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results show that air stripping due to the hydrogen sparge significantly reduces the chlorophenol concentrations in the reactor and inhibits kinetic investigations. Deactivation studies suggest that the catalyst retains its form after reaction, but further analysis is needed.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_316869e4c84633476108dac998b5304b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_dcf18a800bcbdae56502564cfb2f7661" level="item"><did><unittitle>Establishing ocular cell lines to monitor the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) activity in cells with fluorescent GFP reporters</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.012.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bhargava, Pooja</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b3c70b771a698dbbaa49a17e27dbc536">Background:  The Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a critical role in nearly every biological process that includes the removal of undesired damaged proteins. Reduction of UPS capacity is associated with aging and several age-related diseases.  In order to understand the relationship between the accumulation of damaged proteins and aging or age-related diseases a reliable experimental system is necessary for measuring capacity of UPS. We establish an experimental procedure to measure capacity of UPS based on a GFP-fusion UPS reporter, Ub-G76V-GFP, constitutively expressed in Hela cells, a cell line prepared by other groups (Dantuma et al., 2000).  We develop a method for cyclohexamide chase assay of the UPS reporter by utilizing fluorescence spectroscopy.  Methods and Findings: Cyclohexamide (CHX) chase assay of Ub-G76V-GFP was performed to measure the degradation kinetics of the UPS reporter. CHX chase assay was chosen as a method in order to eliminate the concern about the potential changes in the transcriptional rate of the UPS reporter. We used fluorescence spectrometry (fluorescence plate reader) and Western blotting to measure the level of Ub-G76V-GFP. The Hela cells constitutively expressing Ub-G76V-GFP were first incubated for 3 hours with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in order to accumulate the reporter to an observable level. After MG132 was removed, cells were incubated with or without cyclohexamide or cyclohexamide and MG132 combined. These cells were harvested at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours during incubation and lysed in a buffer containing detergent (1% Triton X-100 and 0.03% SDS), and the level of Ub-G76V-GFP in the whole cell lysate and detergent soluble fraction was measured. With cyclohexamide alone, most Ub-G76V-GFP was degraded within 4 hours. Without cyclohexamide, most of Ub-G76V-GFP was still degraded in 6 hours. As expected, MG132 significantly blocked the degradation of Ub-G76V-GFP, although some of the Ub-G76V-GFP (~40%) was still degraded over 6 hours. Essentially, Ub-G76V-GFP in the whole cell lysate and detergent soluble fraction showed the same degradation rate, and almost no Ub-G76V-GFP was detected in the detergent insoluble fraction.  Conclusions:  In this project, a method of monitoring the UPS reporter was established. This procedure can be used in the future to examine the effect of aging and protein -damaging stress on the capacity of the UPS. When using this method, we recommend performing the experiment within 4 hours because of the rapid degradation kinetics of Ub-G76V-GFP.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6888e9f5e20fa6036e479657aa5b4eac"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7dc7078ab212e1928c6c2a490217541d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Facile Synthesis of Viral Templated Photocatalysts for Environmental Applications</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.013.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Burchell, Doreen Katherine</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f60b5b6cdfa15fab9ea5ea38ad33c231">As petroleum based fuels are becoming more difficult to locate and extract, alternate sources of energy as well as more efficient methods for their extraction require immediate attention. Water splitting is a promising alternative for the production of hydrogen fuel from light and water. Titanium dioxide is a common, non-toxic and inexpensive photoactive material capable of catalyzing this reaction. In this experiment, genetically modified tobacco mosaic virus assembled on functionalized glass served as a template for the formation of nanoscale titanium dioxide particles through an adsorption-hydrolysis cycle reaction of titanium dioxide precursors. Characterization of the surface composition of the material through XPS showed the material consisted of majority titanium dioxide and some titanium trioxide with oxygen and titanium in a 2:1 ratio. Examination of surface morphology through AFM revealed particle sizes increased with increasing cycle number. Tunable virus surface assembly density and particle size offer two dimensions of control with which the photocatalytically active titanium dioxide is synthesized in the pursuit toward fabrication of more efficient catalytic materials.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4cca1aae29e22e7c9b0f3c917c4ed8f9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Renewable energy sources</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_430f402b4d76697b56b8b24df16b0bd3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effect of Interlayer Insertion into Bilayer Organic Solar Cells</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.014.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cooper, Richard Dylan</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cbf06bf3691a2f21e4411bac6af54939">Organic solar cells show potential to be an alternative to conventional inorganic solar cells due to the possibility for lower processing costs, flexibility, and large-scale fabrication techniques. The goal of this project was to increase the efficiency of bilayer organic solar cells by increasing the maximum operating voltage. In this study, it was hypothesized that the addition of an insulating material into the active layer could boost the open-circuit voltage. A thin layer of either bathocuproine or lithium fluoride (LiF) was inserted at the interface of both copper phthalocyanine/fullerene (CuPc/C60) and poly(3-hexylthiophene)/fullerene (P3HT/C60) donor/acceptor organic solar cells. The insertion of LiF at the P3HT/C60 interface increased the open-circuit voltage by 11.7% without a substantial reduction in the short-circuit current density. The other modified active layers did not show an improvement in overall solar cell performance. Active layer surface morphology was examined using tapping mode atomic force microscopy.  The higher open-circuit voltage of the P3HT/LiF/C60 device may be attributed to unique morphological changes in the active layer or other energetic effects.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9e243ce3e9c69cb46b4be54bbc72816b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Solar cells</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_99db038df9c60aef75ef94b5b6002a97" level="item"><did><unittitle>Color tunability of organic light emitting devices through Singlet oxygen Color tunability of organic light emitting devices through singlet oxygen exposure of chemical dopants</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.015.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ramjattan, Sanya Tamira</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_26d4b29f839415960bf5da9e734dc8c3">Display technologies are rapidly developing to match consumer needs and manufacturers are becoming more interested in organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) as they are promising candidates for flexible displays and light-weight, transparent devices. This research involved the fabrication and optimization of novel OLEDs incorporating doped photo-emissive polyfluorenes, with the specific goal of achieving patternable devices for economic manufacture. The experimental methods employed are less energy intensive and more amenable to flexible applications than those for most inorganic LEDs. Devices synthesized with a blue-emitting polyfluorene and doped with green, amber and red emitting acenes have been characterized. The electroluminescent stability and color tunability of dopant endoperoxides have also been investigated. Doping was found to increase external quantum efficiency by two orders of magnitude; the trend in efficiency mirrored the degree of overlap between dopant absorption and host emission. Oxidation of acenes to form the endoperoxide produced electroluminescent spectra which exhibited different color and stability characteristics from un-oxidized devices. Evidence of the polyfluorene host was present in peroxide spectra but not in doped device spectra, indicating that oxidation successfully deactivated dopants and achieved color tunability. The exception was pentacene peroxide devices which became more stable after treatment and demonstrated high efficiency but no change in color.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0412c386556c5aec7d9087bb4794574b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_5c07c9bde79368eab961e620da5599fb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Finite Element Method Based Multigrid Solvers for the Diffusion Equation and Fast Adaptive Composite-Grid Solvers for the  Poisson Equation</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.016.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stotsky, Jay Alexander</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6a568f9f3ed8ad59dd43d855ffbc2215">Partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in numerous disciplines, especially in engineering and science. Many important phenomena are governed by PDEs, and their solutions often provide important theoretical and practical insight. For most PDE problems, there exist no analytical solutions so numerical methods must be employed to obtain approximations of the exact solution. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a commonly used numerical method of solving PDEs. With the FEM, a partial differential equation can be converted into a set of algebraic equations which, when solved yield a good approximation of the exact solution to the PDE. Unfortunately, accurate, high resolution results require very high numbers of equations to be solved, and solving these algebraic equations becomes extremely costly at levels of accuracy that are often far too low for many applications. Multigrid methods provide a means to rapidly and efficiently solving the algebraic equations derived from the discretization of a partial differential equation. Finite Element Method based multigrid solvers will be developed to solve two different partial differential equations. The first multigrid solver examined will be used to solve an equation that arises in the study of the dispersion electron beams as they interact with matter. As a beam of electrons comes into contact with matter, the electrons are deflected as they collide with atoms in the matter. The electron density can be described by the Focker-Planck equation. One term in this equation involves a quantity that governs the direction which electrons are traveling. This direction variable can be modelled by diffusion on the surface of a sphere. An efficient FEM based multigrid scheme to solve the diffusion equation on the sphere will be developed and results shown. In the second case, a special version of the multigrid algorithm, known as the Fast Adaptive Composite Grid (FAC) method which can incorporate adaptive mesh refinement discretizations will be discussed. This extension to regular multigrid will be derived using a FEM based solver and will be used to solve the Poisson equation in one dimension and in two dimensions on the unit square.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7d365d510f8c973a0b1a9868f80e0c06"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a92dc3b627b30f28131c5a2e693400e8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Controlled Fabrication of Shape-encoded Macroporous Microparticles with Replica Molding via Phase Separation</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.017.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Abel, John H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b44ba2cf7de6e816acb65f453cf46e8e">Facile fabrication of non-spherical, shape-controlled microparticles with large pores is an important challenge toward the development of high capacity functional microplatforms, especially in biosensing.  This thesis presents a method of fabricating shape-controlled macroporous microparticles through a replica molding-phase separation (RM-PS) strategy. RM is a robust soft-lithographic technique involving the use of microscale molds and UV light-induced radical polymerization to create polymeric microparticles with reliable duplication of complex 2D shapes. Hildebrand solubility parameter (HSP) in conjunction with the group contribution method is used to predict phase separation while in-mold, and through selection of an inert porogen material, to control pore size. This strategy is employed in the fabrication of macroporous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) microparticles with phthalate porogen solvents. Results demonstrate reliable macroporous microparticle fabrication, while retaining structure and physical stability. The pore size is shown to increase as the monomer-porogen solubility decreases and phase separation becomes more rapid, as predicted by HSP calculations. Importantly, a change in solubility during polymerization is not required using this platform unlike current methods, suggesting the potential for a general method to design and fabricate macroporous microparticles with other polymeric units.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7b9f6e9a2b5addf82a43679621fafc27"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5642c440fe5f59c7c66f97bd2095a348" level="item"><did><unittitle>CuPd Single Atom Alloys as Selective Hydrogenation Catalysts</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.018.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kammert, James Drayton</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fd19ac51df3587ae7ef55d0deba3196b">I synthesize Cu nanoparticles (d&amp;#60;30nm) deposit them on y-Al2O3 support and verify their structure and composition using HRTEM imagery XRD CO chemisorption and H2-TPR.

As a highly robust and well defined rod, TMV is an excellent candidate as a building block for surface assembly and fabrication of functional nanobio-devices. Dynamic self-assembly, via controlled solvent evaporation, was exploited as a facile route to assemble TMV onto the glass surfaces. In the first route, varying the concentrations of TMV and sodium phosphate led to control over TMV density, alignment, and percent coverage. In the second route, the temperature of the system was varied, leading to direct control over TMV array density and alignment. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements were employed for surface characterization. Via this fabrication method, I created well-ordered TMV arrays with very high density and nearly 100% surface coverage.

The constructs that are needed for this treatment option vary depending on the source of the cells used, the culture conditions and the scaffold material used. Although a number of polymers, both natural and synthetic are being used, decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) is becoming more important in these studies as it is a blueprint of how nature creates scaffolds. Its usefulness has been found to include promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation, among other advantages as a scaffold biomaterial. The important factors utilized by ECM in its function are not well understood. Therefore this study sought to examine whether the molecular weight of ECM peptides was an important factor in cardiomyocyte proliferation. Using size-exclusion chromatography to fractionate digested ECM, a protocol was designed to separate the peptides by their molecular sizes. The fractions were characterized by concentration and molecular weight, before being coated onto tissue culture plastic (TCP) and studied for how they influence proliferation of cardiomyocytes cultured on them. The results showed statistical significance in the proliferation of cardiomyocytes on the fractions as compared to standards of TCP and collagen I. Overall, there was no significant difference in the number of proliferating cells between the fractions; while a larger percentage of proliferating cardiomyocytes tended to be on the fractions than the standards. Based on these findings, it was concluded that despite there not being one specific peptide size responsible for proliferation, the peptides obtained in fractions 5 to 7 (with molecular weight sizes of 1 kDa to 6.2 kDa) showed a little more potential to promote proliferation than the other fractions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0ed3965cdb7370fb7c7ac405d1c3ba5d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b0096a43ba75b7cd25cddab65b37c0ca" level="item"><did><unittitle>Prediction, Identification, and Quantification of Microbiota Derived Metabolites in Murine Gut</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.021.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pan, Long Bin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_29f49f4f59d75d05225aa81362e99866">Recent studies have shown that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota plays an important role in the modulation of human health and disease.

Beneficial processes of the microbiota include providing immune functions, maintaining epithelial barrier integrity, extracting nutrient and vitamin from host diets, and carrying out metabolic biotransformation reactions that are not readily available to the host organism (Bien et al., 2013). Substrates that escape digestion in the upper GI tract are utilized by the GI microbiota to produce a complex variety of metabolites. Current processes of identifying the spectrum of metabolites in the GI tract include isolation and characterization of individual bacterial species and untargeted metabolomics approaches. However, these methodologies do not account for the community-wide interactions of bacterial species and the host organism. These approaches also do not differentiate between metabolites produced by the GI microbiota and those by the host. In this study, a targeted metabolomics approach was utilized to predict, identify and quantify a set of metabolites that are nonnative to the host organism. A novel in silico approach was used to predict a set of potential anti-inflammatory metabolites derived from amino acid sources. Analyses with tandem mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography were performed to quantify the levels of predicted metabolites in order to validate the accuracy of the in silico probabilistic algorithm. AhR activation experiments were used to verify the anti-inflammatory properties of metabolites because studies have shown that AhR, a ligand activated transcription factor, plays an important role in intestinal immune functions (Bjeldanes et al., 1991). Once anti-inflammatory metabolites have been determined and analyzed, they can be used for drug discovery and therapeutics.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_01f0957b6a347c1639205b44fd810b87"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_97ad62245cc9c37cd05b624f72a1856a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Enhancement of Organic Solar Cell Performance through Solvent Annealing</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.022.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kane, Derrick Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f27c6a04296ad540ca2dbca04335bb44">Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) has shown promise in organic thin film electronics applications due to its ability to crystallize into ordered nanorods when exposed to solvent. In this study, CuPc nanostructured films were created through thermal evaporation of CuPc and subsequent treatment with acetone vapor for use in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. AFM imaging was used to confirm the growth of the nanorods, which were observed to form after 15 min of treatment and achieve a height of 50 nm after 20 min. Maximum power conversion efficiency obtained was 0.534%, a 46.5% improvement  versus the untreated cell. Efficiencies achieved were significantly lower than previously reported CuPc:PCBM devices in which the acceptor layer (PCBM) was applied by solution processing (typical efficiency  1.5-3.0%). Although CuPc nanorod growth was found to increase surface roughness with increased treatment time, short circuit current density was not statistically improved. Deposition of the acceptor layer by thermal evaporation may have inadequately filled the CuPc nanostructure spacing due  to 3D shadowing  effects of the CuPc nanorods, and allowed the 50 nm nanorods to bridge the active layer and cause current leakage. Furthermore,  the Hildebrand solubility parameter, , was studied as a useful solvent property to correlate with a solvent's effectiveness for CuPc nanorod growth. Using Fedors' group contribution method, the solubility parameter of CuPc was approximated to be 25.09 MPa1/2, with possible error due to the lack data for the copper atom.  Ethanol ( = 26.0 MPa1/2) was chosen as a solvent predicted to have high CuPc solubility, compared to acetone ( = 20 MPa1/2). In case of an underestimate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) ( = 29.7 MPa1/2) was selected as upper bound. Ethanol and DMSO treatments were applied to CuPc films for 15 min. DMSO was found to raise device efficiency to 0.505%, with promising effects on fill factor and surface roughness. Advice regarding further study of DMSO treatment is included.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_33c8d99a5672c2dda87a0e7f0f5e9c3d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b6a991c700325c6f03fce43ef233613d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Development of a 3-Dimensional Fat Model Using Alginate Hydrogels</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.023.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Judith, Jacqueline Elizabeth</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_69a77da02fcfcdd7e0e6284faff0e746">In 2010, more than 35.7% of U.S. adults were considered obese [24]. With obesity comes increased risk for conditions such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes [23]. To combat obesity, more needs to be known about the process of adiposity, the excessive expansion of adipose tissue. As of now, adiposity has been studied through both in vivo and in vitro studies. In vivo studies however, are challenged by numerous uncontrolled factors, which has lead to incon- sistent results [8, 12, 20, 41]. Traditional tissue culture plastic, however, is a vastly different system than found in vivo which has shown to cause discrepancies in morphological features and gene expression when compared to adipocytes in vivo [33]. o address these limitations of current in vitro models, we developed a 3-dimensional cul- ture system that allows for study of adipogenesis in more physiological conditions. Alginate hydrogels are promising as the cells are easily incorporated into the gels, and allow for control of the mechanical properties by altering crosslinking parameters [18]. Our studies have shown some affect of scaffold modulus on cell differentiation, as well as a strong effect of cells bind- ing to the scaffold through RGD functionalization. Our gels also showed an ability to function as an adipogenesis model without the need for pre-differentiation. This alginate hydrogel model was also used to begin studying the effects of obesogens, a group of chemicals thought to promote obesity, through studies involving the introduction of TBT into the medium. Over- all, alginate hydrogels have proven to be very valuable as a 3-dimensional model, our current studies having possibly discovered new directions for the study and understanding of adipogenesis.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_860fe5b7ea5570bbcdad14c82d2be803"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_70106fcd4960946fada8fed64f51675b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Novel Quantum Dot-Ionogel Light Emitting Devices and a Determination of the Mechanism for Electroluminescence</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.024.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nash, Jared H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_66c7c5ad21879bc76cdcd4f4bda58c46">Colloidal quantum dots are an emerging class of nanomaterials beginning to be implemented into commercial displays. Companies such as Sony, QD Vision, and Apple are all currently researching quantum dot display technologies. Quantum dots are semiconducting nanoparticles that emit very saturated colors which make them ideal for displays. This research used colloidal quantum dots and a room temperature ionic liquid suspended in a polymer matrix (ionogel) to create
                                a novel light emitting device architecture. The originally proposed mechanism for this device was to use the ionic liquid in the ionogel to create a large electric field around the quantum dots, causing the quantum dots to self-ionize and emit light. This new device architecture proved to be versatile, using both AC and DC biases. The peak wavelength of the electroluminescence was 612 nm and the emission spectra had a full width half peak of 30 nm; therefore,
                                these devices emitted a saturated red color. The external quantum efficiency was calculated to be approximately 0.002%. These devices were operational in ambient conditions and were stable over a period of at least 3.5 hours. Because the devices were operational using a DC bias, the mechanism for electroluminescence could not be the originally proposed mechanism. Device functionality most likely involved a redox reaction with water vapor being one of the
                                reactants. Future work should be performed to determine the reaction responsible for electroluminescence, and to improve the efficiency of light emission.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_69204d349b679604945b15bf05ef9c99"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts Univeristy.

Solar cells, having a wide range of uses and having already shown potential for mass marketability, are key to moving away from fossil fuels and natural gas as the main sources of energy production. Consequentially, it has also become necessary to reduce both the capital and energy costs of solar
                                cell manufacturing. In this research, only cheap and abundant resources were used along with non-energy intensive processing through electrodeposition in the development of solar cells. Special focus was dedicated to optimizing the deposition of zinc oxide (ZnO) to improve the efficiency of the solar cell. The optimal methodology was the deposition of zinc metal first, followed by the formation of ZnO by annealing the zinc metal film. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was then
                                deposited on top of the ZnO as a means of creating an effective p-n heterojunction. However, due to deposition difficulties, it was not possible to construct an effective p-n junction. Nevertheless, the most effective ZnO deposition process was successfully characterized.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ee3e6ce6b0ec295d87ec65bf0fc3fd5a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering.</subject><subject source="local">Solar cells -- Research.</subject><subject source="local">Solar cells -- Design and construction.</subject><subject source="local">Solar cells -- Materials.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f7c9d2689a09916c72a70a4ef348ba52" level="item"><did><unittitle>Atom Tracing: An Investigative Tool for the Study of Host-Gut Microbiota Co-Metabolism</unittitle><unitid>UA005.012.026.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ghaddar, Bassel Chahid</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_dde5896824225adf25cfba9ceff63ea2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_0857e2ed13bd3cdf64ebb74beb5ee4c4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this work, we present a computational method to investigate gut microbiota-host metabolic interactions. Due to the diversity of species present in the gut that may contribute to the metabolism of certain substrates and the subsequent community level interactions between the different bacterial species and the host cells, an atomic level approach is taken. In particular, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is used to assemble various metabolic models representing different proportions of murine host cells and various bacterial phyla (Kanehisa Laboratories, 2015). Pathways between common dietary nutrients that would be present in the GI tract to bioactive gut metabolites of interest are then investigated using a reachability analysis and a 'random-walks' pathfinding algorithm. Finally, an atom tracing function is implored to determine the conservation of atoms along the pathway, and model results are compared against each other. It is the hope
                that such an analysis will lead to new insights to the atomic level contribution of various gut flora to the synthesis of bioactive gut metabolites.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

more than a generic mass.  This paper begins to fill that gap, addressing the audience as a material carefully considered by artists as part of the performance.  Since performance art is a vast and heterogeneous category, this study limits itself to performance art in public spaces, using theories of public space to understand how each artist or group of artists conceptualizes public space and uses the audience within that space.  Chapter one considers the Situationist International through the lens of Jurgen Habermas, chapter two applies the work of Rosalyn Deutsche and Laura Mulvey to Valie Export, and chapter three examines Coco Fusco and Guillermo Gomez-Pena in terms of Homi Bhabha.  Each work under consideration here calls attention to a hidden lack or inequality in public space, using the audience as the site on which that inequality is first made visible and then subverted.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_77457816b653adbc7a51101b216b3e23"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Art and Art History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1d67d90266b27a91635021dededce2a2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Spaces of Embodiment: The Public Bathroom Networks of Paris and New York</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.016.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ayat, Daniel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_33ae1061b5f46b32f900e26c84b3b0d8" label="Books [39090015513613b]" type="box">Volume 16</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9d1fe10e62e9a6b116be5183a99f7f15"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Art and Art History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d792aeaf90ecd69f84eafb312c863932" level="item"><did><unittitle>Adaptive Reuse of Mega-Stores: Transforming an Icon of Suburban Inefficiency into a Model of Sustainability</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.017.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hoffman, Elaine G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cbf315008d7cda2d86f10aa9faacf9b4">As the main focus of this thesis, I analyze the practice of converting these mega-stores from big abandoned boxes to workable sites, and compare this technique to other alternatives, such as destruction of the building and its surrounding parking lot.

Recognizing that these works were produced at a uniquely critical time in the history of the Dutch nation, my thesis represents an multidisciplinary exploration in interpretive possibilities.  My hypothesis offers that these works may serve as a psychological workspace for the construction and articulation of a collective proto-national Dutch identity, one in which "Dutch" and "bourgeois" are conflated.  In conspicuously excluding the evidence of recent traumatic events to create the idyllic domestic realm in which Dutch identity is worked out, I propose that this group of paintings suggest that these traumatic events themselves may have necessitated the political unification of the future United Republic of the Netherlands and the construction of a collective "Dutch" identity.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9e78108cfe9348386376dc5ca4ffe890"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Art and Art History</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8c1bd557b752e73d820b329c057b74be" level="item"><did><unittitle>An Image Within An Image:  The Representation of Cameos in Cinquecento Portraiture</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.019.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Anderson, Emily R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4dcd37f9d9e796f147eb878774f78837">This thesis combines the scholarship on both fields of cameos and portraiture in order to analyze portraiture containing fictive representations of cameos.

Fundamentally, architecture and fashion share the same purpose, that is, to provide shelter and protection for the human body. In this regard, we live in architecture and fashion. The buildings we inhabit and the clothes we wear transcend elements for survival, as an equal, if not greater importance is placed on their aesthetic value. With this aesthetic quality holding such significance, a building or piece of clothing is instilled with meaning, allowing for their other basic functions as means of identity expression. It is through the design process, attention to detail, and quality in construction that these basic elements of daily life are heightened to art forms. Both architecture and fashion make distinctions between "high" and "low" works produced by their field. The fact that these distinctions are made in both architecture and fashion unites the two fields, as each grapple with making art and producing consumable products. During the last century certain architects and fashion designers have achieved an iconic status both within their field and in popular culture. These individuals have transcended the constraints of their professional world and have become household names. Eight iconic architects and fashion designers are examined, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, Philip Johnson, Yves Saint Laurent, I. M. Pei, Frank Gehry, and Alexander McQueen. The construction of such icons by both fashion and architecture is a unique phenomenon that strengthens the relationship between the two fields.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_73e6dc806bb7db71b984cee0a7873526"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Fashion and architecture</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_20cec7bcb04da99b8f8a8f48ba885395" level="item"><did><unittitle>Vulnerable and Threatening: Edward Hopper's Female Nudes</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.021.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rice, Katherine E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7113ef2329665f59be297a2926d7610b">Edward Hopper's oeuvre provokes a great deal of scholarship in the art historical field. There is, however, a decided lack of psychoanalytic theory applied to his paintings. Hopper's complex biography demonstrates the need for such a theoretical approach. This approach is particularly necessary when analyzing five of his female nudes. This thesis closely explores "Summer Interior," "Evening Wind," "Eleven A.M.," "Morning in a City," and "A Woman in the Sun." The works are artistic manifestations of Hopper's repressed anxieties regarding women. Hopper confines female subjects to his canvas, exerting his masculinity in a way that he could not in reality. Examining these works reveals further intricacies in Hopper's relationships with women. The pieces also acknowledge changes that were taking place in twentieth century America. Female autonomy grew as women entered the workforce, embraced their sexuality, and abandoned the limitations of their Victorian upbringings. Hopper's female nudes can therefore be seen as depicting male apprehensions about the new roles that women were playing. This thesis examines Hopper's female nudes formally, historically, biographically, and psychoanalytically, finding that they demonstrate Hopper's attempt to relegate the female to a sphere of his complete control.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_18eedb92ffa3ee84cc7e90c4140b4d12"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Psychoanalytic Theory</subject><persname source="local">Hopper, Edward, 1882-1967</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d59f1cdcbc16fbaa091092d8e4fa3633" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Politics of Visual Culture: 2010 Shanghai World Expo</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.022.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wang, Lumay</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1413ab86f49badc0025a67ad781c3e54">Exhibitions, architecture, and maps all fall into the realm of visual culture, and each can transmit and convey specified messages. The politics of visual culture is integral to understanding how knowledge, taste, and power are formed. One should look at world expositions and in particular, the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, because the role of representation and the visual is augmented exponentially. Given China's fast economic growth, the Expo served as a huge opportunity for foreign nations to present their identities, their culture, and their products. This thesis explores how the Shanghai Expo demonstrates the power of the visual to manipulate, to guide, and to lead people's perceptions of their identity, their reality, and the world at large. It also examines the politics of representation. In particular the research focuses on European Union identity, the visual cohesiveness or lack thereof of the political and economic union, and the implications of the identity. Through in-depth visual analysis and aided by interviews, photographs, and other primary sources, this thesis critically examines international relations relevant to contemporary society.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2712b0645eb8994d20b40d8a55440674"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Exhibition buildings</subject><subject source="local">Architectural design</subject><persname source="local">Shanghai World Expo (2010 : China)</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5e2779e074d79c5861f4a3113a1d3070" level="item"><did><unittitle>Art as Catalyst in the Politicization of Ai Weiwei</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.023.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hu, Jielin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4facd21c88646394fa98ea3d447b4c43">Ai Weiwei, one of the most influential contemporary Chinese artists, has occupied headline position in the media since his 81-day detention in the summer of 2011 by the Chinese government. The Western media focuses on his outspoken attitude about socio-political problems in China and frequently refers to him as _��an activist_�� or _��a dissident_��. It seems that the whole world is so preoccupied by his activism and has forgotten that Ai Weiwei, at heart, is an artist. My thesis cautions against the politicization of Ai Weiwei by the Western media and offers a more comprehensive reading of Ai Weiwei_�_s art in this political context. My paper examines Ai Weiwei_�_s aesthetics to show that art and politics are inseparable for him. Further, I argue through an in-depth analysis of Fairytale (2007) and Remembering (2009) that Ai Weiwei uses art as a vehicle of communication and change, and one cannot understand his political stance without acknowledging his art.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c4f133feea977f957bd93b05d1dae904"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_10c5ed18b6f82b0b2293a709f5aef73d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Simon Vouet and Jacques Blanchard: rivalité à Paris?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.024.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kulewicz, Adam Alexander Michel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_58f0925442580617a4d0d2a02e1bea1a">This thesis examines the supposed rivalry between two seventeenth-century French painters: Simon Vouet and Jacques Blanchard.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4ed0d496b500ff159ddad9128b7d634d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_212af708e5b532f00b81df264cc5e3ea" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Architecture of Play</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.025.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">DeCamp, Mary Lowery</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3f2f9d924793b96b1c217e1296697800">Playgrounds have long been a fixture of childhood and the built environment and were first introduced in America in the late nineteenth century.  Certain architectural qualities of playgrounds can lead to specific, important developmental outcomes for a child by facilitating stimulating play.  Despite research which proves this as well as the acknowledgment of the failures of certain playground types, the design of playgrounds remains unchanged.  
\
The repetition of these failed forms of architecture derives from historical notions of childhood and adults' perceptions of child's play itself.  Even something that might be considered pure and simple like children's play is not removed from social influence, and neither is its architecture.  Through examining later instances of the interaction of play and the environment, such as skateboarding, tree houses, and the film _��Inception,_�� adults can understand their own complex relationship with architecture that facilitates fun and enjoyment.  When adults more fully recognize their own emotional relationships with architecture, especially as related to play, they can more successfully implement better-designed playgrounds.  Ultimately, to negotiate the ideologies and factors that have stagnated the design of playgrounds, my suggestions for a more unified and coherent play experience as portended by play spaces reside in viewing architecture as if it were a person, and more specifically, a friend or playmate.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_607bedb5757f9732c59bca82cab76788"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_696148848aefabc9b1add92d0d7616b9" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Strange Chaos: Preserving Internet Art in the Wake of Walter Benjamin's Critical Legacy</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.026.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Boxer, Carly B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_90bab5e5cc4d5d0f3803239bd5145e8a">This thesis explores current approaches to preserving Internet art, and examines comparisons made between Internet art and earlier media from a theoretical perspective. Contemporary preservation implicitly accepts as true twentieth-century literary critic Walter Benjamin's contention that the mechanically reproduced work of art loses its aura and falls victim to ideological objectives: in so doing, the work risks inauthenticity, both in the experience it provides its viewer and in its function within a larger ideological system. The works that Internet art are associated with retain medium-specific elements; they value display materials from a work's first exhibition, they prioritize an original' performance, they ascribe value to the unadulterated display of an individual artist's aesthetic tendencies, and they are exhibited within a gallery or museum. These traits allow curators and conservators to legitimately assert the existence of some authentic' work that can be experienced and preserved. Internet art, however, demonstrates none of these characteristics. This thesis argues that current suggested practices for preserving Internet art and the frequent comparisons made between Internet art, variable media art, and performance ignore those characteristics most central to Internet art's eponymous medium: its place outside the walls of the traditional museum, its ability to exist in infinite iterations with no original' taking priority, its unusual relationship to time, and the ways in which it shatters expectations of single authorship.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bd861b9846fc992b808b0fdcf943d281"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Art and Art History</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_12e068aabf4daee21d484db4c32298a1" level="item"><did><unittitle>And You Will Find the Truth Here : A Neglected Seventh-Century Description of the Holy Sepulchre</unittitle><unitid>UA005.013.027.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kroetch, Kathryn Julieann</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_50bba127f9238114f5b710913897ff88">Through the seventh-century description of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem by the Armenian pilgrim Hovsp, this thesis explores the notion of sacred space and architecture through the lens of an Armenian perspective. The Holy Sepulchre stands as a central monument of Christianity and as a model for architectural copies in the Early Middle Ages. Hovsp describes the structure in a manner that utilizes his Armenian experience, providing scholars with an alternative approach to the church. Since his text has not yet been used in a manner that explores the relationship between Hovsp, the Holy Sepulchre, and Armenian architecture, this thesis begins to fill the gap in order to call attention to the pilgrim and his important text.

I have sought to bring these two together in my thesis, to gain a better and more complete picture of how Kerver's printed books of hours functioned in context. My first two chapters address the scholarship on early print, and the&#13;
                                characteristics used to evaluate the relationship between early print and manuscript. In a series of lectures delivered in 1960 and later published in a volume entitled, The Fifteenth Century Book: the scribes, the printers, the decorators, Curt Bu_hler first suggested that profound connections existed between early print and manuscript.11 Sandra Hindman, in an essay published in, Pen to Press: Illustrated Manuscripts and Printed Books in the First Century of&#13;
                                Printing, expands on this narrative by exploring the incunabula's fruitful experimentations with a mixture of print and hand-painted elements in illustration.12 Hindman suggests that early print and manuscript had fundamental similarities, of iconography, of illustration materials, and of format.13 These early studies frame my work on Kerver's books of hours. They provided the grounds for an analysis of Kerver's works which does not isolate his print production,&#13;
                                but rather seeks to better understand Kerver's printed hours by looking at their connections to manuscript production.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bcafcc390932034a923989a45829b6c0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In this way, Soulages's paintings seem to exist solely as the traces of gesture, the memories of an act that can be alluded to but never fully recounted within the work. Taking this gap between trace and gesture as a premise, my thesis argues that Soulages's paintings generate paradoxical impressions of presence and absence, as well as of embodiment and disembodiment, through their freezing of gesture into trace, and I illustrate this argument by placing Soulages's paintings first in relation to the prehistoric cave paintings of Lascaux, France and subsequently with the drawings of French artist Henri Michaux.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The cell phone novel is uniquely modern as the authors tap out their works on the keypads of their cell phones, which they later upload onto the net for readers to comment. The language and structure of a cell phone novel resembles that of a text message; sentences are short, random, non-descriptive, laden with slang and acronyms. It is for this reason that the cell phone novel became grossly popular among the younger Japanese generation allowed it to establish itself as a whole new genre.  The popularity of the cell phone novel has crossed international borders into countries like China, Korea, and Taiwan, but the new fad has yet to reach Europe or the United States. This partly due to the fact that no cell phone novel has been officially translated into the English language. It is no surprise though, as the Japanese languages is often proves extremely difficult to translate into English since subject and object are mandatory in English to complete a sentence whereas in Japanese they are not. Plus, with the cell phone novel deeply rooted in popular culture it is necessary to have thorough knowledge of Japanese school life and American popular culture in order to preserve the essence of the original text.  This paper includes a full English translation of If You and a introduction that explores and evaluates the difficulty of Japanese-English translations as well as the potential of US recognition. If You is a 142-page novel written by 21-year-old Rin that follows two childhood friends as they encounter high school, love, and the harsh reality of HIV. The book ranked #5 on the Japanese best-seller list in 2007.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_457fee34c13d991e4e7da9e445b3522a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of German, Russian, and Asian Languages and Literature</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_561c109e0c991eb19d5d1fcff281da93" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Subaltern War Hero in 21st Century Russian Cinema: Redefining the Russian Heroic Tradition and the Russian Nation in Multi-Ethnic Terms</unittitle><unitid>UA005.014.010.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Korenewsky, Aaron W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2ddf70293b0118d097652d01d418e37a">21st Century Russian cinema is presenting the non-Russian in heroic roles, redefining the nation in multi-ethnic terms. This represents a departure from the films of the 1990's, and continues the evolution of the role of minorities in Russian history and culture. Analyzing some of the most financially and culturally significant films for their depiction of the hero, this thesis reveals a tendency among Russian directors to place non-Russians in positive roles, which has garnered government support. These films tie into a greater debate on Russianness, and raise questions about why these characters are included and what path this will take in the future.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ac3df8c59ca8e3114f8c9ec9d02d12ee"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Motion pictures</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4cf484324ee9a088c04a4906e6aefe50" level="item"><did><unittitle>Disjointed Parts: An Introduction to the SF Short-Shorts of Hoshi Shinichi</unittitle><unitid>UA005.014.011.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cronin, Caitlin N.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ebec81efdf0610a2443c08699bae7fad">A translation of thirteen short stories from Hoshi Shinichi's "Disjointed Parts" collection, featuring an introduction to the author's style and an analysis of themes in the work.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b308b5322d763dbe8741b606e7a485c9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Translations</subject><persname source="local">Hoshi, Shinichi</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ece6b36d1b43ff568261a7c27ef2e143" level="item"><did><unittitle>Identity as Monstrosity in Contemporary Japan: Crises of the Fluctuating Self in Spirited Away, Paprika, and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</unittitle><unitid>UA005.014.012.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Inch, Lauren Michelle</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1c7e4f668f78ef59f1268f9fc6d4d308">This paper examines crises of identity as they are portrayed in Miyazaki Hayao's Spirited Away, Satoshi Kon's Paprika, and Oshii Mamoru's Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, and focuses on the fact that traits of fantasy and monstrosity are used as vehicles to explore the self.  Such representation reflects the doubts of a society in which people are often uncomfortable with, or lack understanding of, their own identity.  This paper argues that changeablility and transformation are becoming a part of how people see the contemporary self, and these buried issues of monstrosity  hint at an unease with how identity is constructed, and how the individual views their own self.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fe9a1a1b0aed392b5ead526fedb913f0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Anime</subject><persname source="local">Kon, Satoshi, 1963-2010</persname><persname source="local">Hayao, Miyazaki</persname><persname source="local">Oshii, Mamoru</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1556cba083f58e26a217b4ae6c772ff8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Sexual Equality in Russia: Reconciling Gay Pride &amp; The Russian Tradition</unittitle><unitid>UA005.014.013.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Carey, Lilia T.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6ddd278d7066b6712bb8953e67122399">The purpose of this thesis is to present a contemporary examination of Russia_�_s gay pride movement. In particular, this study will focus on why the tactics currently used by Russia_�_s gay activists are preventing gay pride campaigns from reaching their goal of greater social and legal equalities for sexual minorities. An evaluation of activist_�_s actions and ideologies will help to provide answers to this question. The study also gauges the desire of LGBT Russians to have a successful gay pride movement, and what the definition of _��success_�_ is in the Russian context. This definition is elucidated by a discussion of the applicability of Western examples of gay pride to the Russian case.
\
The scope of the study spans the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 to the spring of 2012. The research presented is based on publications from numerous periodicals, documentary films, and previously published scholarly texts that are related to the subjects of gay pride and Russian LGBT culture. 
\
The principle conclusion of this study asserts that the campaign strategies of Russian gay pride activists are negatively impacting the movement_�_s own attempts to advance the rights of sexual minorities. Many Russians, both within and outside of Russia_�_s LGBT community, oppose the country_�_s gay activist movement ideologically, methodologically, or altogether. Evidence that a portion of the LGBT community does not stand behind the goals of their country_�_s gay pride movement reveals a disconnect between the activist_�_s objectives and the desires of those it claims to represent. This misinterpretation is in part explained by the encouragement of Western involvement by leaders of the Russian movement despite many Russians_�_ disillusionment with Western-style gay pride movements.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_234f30aea592204fd6c7de4cd7140606"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_146461f601bce0bd93ece8ed43b9a6a5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Reaching You: A Translation of Kimi ni Todoke</unittitle><unitid>UA005.014.014.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Vu, Tam T.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f2571d112c51fea69cbb361457ed627f">This thesis is a translation of the light novel adaptation of the popular manga (graphic novel) series called 'Kimi ni Todoke'. Light novel or ranobe in Japanese is a type of novel that targets middle and high school students. Characteristics of a light novel are the short sentences, the short paragraphs comprised of a couple of lines, the simple and colloquial language, the lack of difficult Chinese characters (kanji) and the few illustrations. This style of writing is easier and faster for the target audience to read. Also, the books are usually no longer than 200 pages and are quite cheap, roughly $5. Although light novels became a huge hit in 2006, the light novels have been around before 1975 (this year is considered to be the start of the history of the light novels). Now, the light novels are so popular that there are even contests each year to find new writers. Light novels are also popular choices for adaptations into anime, manga, live _�_action movies. However, sometimes the reverse happens; manga or anime series are adapted into light novels. Despite the obvious popularity of light novels, many critics do not consider light novels to be works of literary merit. Perhaps they are not wrong about this, but the style of the light novel is extraordinarily similar to the shojo shosetsu, which is a style that some authors have based their style off of, such as Yoshimoto Banana. Yoshimoto_�_s style has been called new and minimalistic. She has also stated that she was influenced by shojo manga and shojo shosetsu since she had grown up reading them. Regardless of whether or not light novels can be called works of literature, this type of book may be able to help solve the problem with the younger generation being reluctant to read books. There have been some publishing companies that have licensed and translated some light novel series into English. This series however has yet to be translated, even though the manga series has been translated and is quite popular. This paper includes a translation of the entire first volume of the series and an introduction that explains and explores what a light novel is, the themes and issues presented within the story and its relation to Japanese society, and the difficulties of translation. The story is about a sweet, timid girl named, Sawako Kuronuma, who is feared by her classmates because of her resemblance to Sadako from _��The Ring._�� The story follows Sawako on her journey to make friends and her evolution as a person.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0f0da297dec882fa9442f32588cd6450"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_39c275e3ff0318a1dc89bf6fa4cc3ede" level="item"><did><unittitle>Wary in Your Dealings: The Haredi Relationship with Secular Government</unittitle><unitid>UA005.014.015.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kaytrosh, John Peter</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_92cba7415e1e8fa468330d79bddb6e21">Not enough research has been done to address how Haredi Jewish (also known as ultra-Orthodox) groups interact with secular government in the United States. Most studies, if they address government or politics at all, address it as simply another curiosity within the Haredi experience. It is worthwhile to address the question of what explains the form of this political involvement, and that is precisely the goal of this thesis. The paper takes a comparative approach, analyzing the similarities and differences in different Haredi groups_�_ (Hasidic, non-Hasidic, and Chabad-Lubavitch) involvement as compared to each other, and across different dimensions of engagement (bureaucratic, legislative-electoral, and ideological). Much of the analysis in this thesis will center on the question of how religious philosophy, orientation, emphasis, and practice shape the form of a particular group_�_s involvement.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_334cbe71171d96f39a024499bd9adfc6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_f5ac6a0672194b407bb8544f679b3c46" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Ring Finger Specimen</unittitle><unitid>UA005.014.016.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ospina, Ignacio</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_744b88517ad3fccb63922bf9a2e27007">Japanese author Yoko Ogawa has written more than twenty works since 1988, yet the number of works published in English is few.

These fabulously wealthy individuals rose from Soviet obscurity to unprecedented influence in Russia during the 1990s. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Boris Berezovsky, and others cultivated close relations with the government, epitomized in 1996 when the oligarchs saved President Yeltsin from certain electoral defeat. Informal, extra-legal relations among the oligarchs and the government solidified the oligarchs' influence and wealth. When Vladimir Putin rose to power in 1999, he used these informal relations to curb the power of the oligarchs. Rather than launch a crusade against the oligarchs however, as many have argued, Putin restructured the priorities of the oligarchs. Expelling or imprisoning a few of them as an example, Putin ensured the loyalty of those remaining. These oligarchs are still essential to Putin's system of \managed democracy\" and his continued power."</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bb83c53075345a69ecb8ef88dab49d1b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of German, Russian, and Asian Languages and Literatures</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8e2d11f838855a6468bff3a7abf57016" level="item"><did><unittitle>Embracing Sorrow: Japan's Atomic Haiku</unittitle><unitid>UA005.014.019.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ota, Veronica Toyomi</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_30dfce5ce5a5c29f49e88aa512452a54">A collection of translated haiku written about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4d19effe28bcfa4f0d8266652f30e08d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Hiroshima-shi (Japan) -- History -- Bombardment, 1945 -- Poetry.</geogname><geogname source="local">Nagasaki-shi (Japan) -- History -- Bombardment, 1945 -- Poetry.</geogname><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Put into simplest terms, it is an act of humorously reacting to another person's words, action, or attribute. Citing various Japanese and English sources, the thesis studies the concept beginning with its definition, its meaning as a word in the Japanese language, its history as a role in the Japanese double-act stand-up comedy manzai, its applications in people's everyday lives in Japan, and goes on to look at Japanese thinkers who consider tsukkomi's impact on the Japanese society. Hopefully, the thesis can provide its readers an ample amount of information on a concept that is both immensely popular in Japan, and rarely heard of in English-speaking countries.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Japan--Humor--Social aspects.</geogname><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

With over 55% of this population under the age of 18, both Jordanian and international organizations are struggling to provide the children of Za`atari with quality education. The question remains, however, what characterizes quality education in the context of a refugee camp? International bodies such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies provide standards for teacher training and pedagogy that highlight the importance of psychosocial support in refugee classrooms. Drawing from these standards and Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed, I determine that didactic pedagogy is ineffective in refugee education; studies in social neuroscience indicate that children who are affected by instability, high-stress environments, and forced
                displacement require relationship-centered, dialogical learning environments to learn effectively. Making use of official documents and reports, studies of Jordan's education system, and interviews with professionals working in Za`atari camp's education sector, I evaluate the extent to which Freire's model of problem-posing education is present within Za`atari camp. Through this study, it is clear that, due to infrastructural and systematic obstacles, teachers in Za`atari's formal education sector rely on authoritarian teaching methods and are not prepared to implement Freirean techniques in the classroom; until these obstacles are addressed, the provision of truly effective education will remain relegated to the sector of informal education.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

metabolic activity of yeast to its aging phenotype. Mammals have seven Sir2 homologs, SIRT1-7, which have conserved NAD-dependent deacetylase and/or ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. Although mammalian sirtuins have not been shown to regulate life span, they affect various cellular processes including cell survival and metabolism. In this project, we study SIRT5, a mitochondrial sirtuin previously shown to regulate carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the rate-limiting enzyme of the urea cycle, via reversible acetylation. Our aim was to determine whether SIRT5 regulates cholesterol metabolism. We show that SIRT5 KO mice on high cholesterol diet had lower levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in their serum, but this phenotype did not repeat in a following trial. Also, we show that expression levels of select genes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are upregulated in the heart of SIRT5 KO mice. Our findings highlight the importance for future studies in uncovering new functions of SIRT5.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5b56a54d1acdf587ae9bfbd1d1936214"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Chemistry</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_311cdfd2f1f0202609807f92377083bf" level="item"><did><unittitle>Development of a ligation-based assay to genotype mitochondrial SNPs to trace maternal ancestry using a low-cost readout</unittitle><unitid>UA005.015.011.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Philips, Sarah Rose</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1530c3cc8b1a7aacf9e357f53301d816">We developed a low-cost, ligation-based assay for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that will allow inexperienced high school and college students to trace their maternal ancestry.

When the photosensitizer, eosin 5-isothiocyanate, is bound to NeutrAvidin labeled biotinylated microspheres, 1O2 is generated; the singlet oxygen then reacts with the quenching conjugated acenes on the thin film to restore the conjugated polymer_�_s fluorescence. Prior to any 1O2 reaction with the acenes, there is an overlap between the poly (9, 9-di-n-dodecylfluorenyl-2, 7-diyl)_�_s (PF) emission and 5, 12-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)tetracene_�_s (TET) absorption which allows for the PF_�_s excited state to be transferred to TET. As singlet oxygen binds to TET, thermodynamically stable endoperoxides are formed, halting any quenching of PF_�_s fluorescence.  Therefore, the fluorescence shifts from the TET, at 510nm, to the conjugated polymer at 420 nm. These experiments demonstrated singlet oxygen, produced by the eosin 5-isothiocyanate/NeutrAvidin/biotinylated microspheres, mediated amplification of fluorescent signals through the ratiometric shift of the TET_�_s fluorescence to that of the PF. This project is unique in its use of multiplicative amplification through wavelength ratiometric signals and singlet oxygen photosensitization without the use of enzymes.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_030bb7fd936e24e25070639d4bffc6c5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_030cbd4be2dff8e618f50101420fefe4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Hydrogen Bonding in Thioether Self-Assembly</unittitle><unitid>UA005.015.016.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">McGuire, Allister F.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fbbf7024951dca0c85a5260eaec0c684">Thioethers represent an interesting alternative to thiols as monomers for molecular self-assembly on metal surfaces. In contrast to thiols, and due to their unique adsorption geometry, thioethers offer the opportunity to control molecular packing in the dimension parallel to the surface, and their weaker surface binding can lead to monolayers with a lower defect density. In a step towards designing thioether monolayers with multiple functionalities, we have investigated the molecular-scale assembly of 3-(methylthio)propanol on Au(111). Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that the hydroxyl groups drive the formation of an array of novel structures that are not observed with the analogous thioether, butyl methyl sulfide. The hydrogen-bonding-driven ordering yields linear chains and hexamer rings that are very similar in structure to methanol assemblies on Au(111). At near-monolayer coverage, very ordered monolayers are observed. The adsorption is strong enough to lift the native herringbone reconstruction of the Au(111) surface but stops short of removing additional atoms, as is the case with thiols. While these monolayer structures are similar to those of non-functionalized butyl methyl sulfide, hydrogen bonding between adjacent rows leads to lamellar structures with a hydrophilic core and hydrophobic exterior. As such, these assemblies are one-dimensional analogues of the lipid bilayer.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d8ade2dd2ee6d8ef465da0e80a91ad7f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_1494eb04e0ca35546b1dd2358fe5017d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Development of novel methods to characterize restriction endonuclease kinetics and specificity</unittitle><unitid>UA005.015.017.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wilburn, Frances C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_61cf57659d96a4c1b4270f827425340b">Restriction endonucleases are enzymes that cleave double stranded DNA and are widely used in recombinant DNA technology, yet much about their mechanisms of action is poorly understood.  It is the goal of this research to fill the information gap on restriction endonucleases and increase our understanding of how these enzymes work by addressing the lack of kinetic data on type II restriction endonucleases.  A novel fluorescence-based approach was used to track the progress of the cleavage of short synthetic DNA oligonucleotides by restriction endonucleases in real time.  This approach was used to determine kinetic parameters of EcoRV and PvuII in bulk solution and adapted to a fiber-optic array platform that would allow for single-molecule kinetic data.  Ultimately this research will lead to single-molecule observations of restriction endonuclease activity, which will give greater insight into their mechanisms than bulk data can provide.

In this project we use Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) to detect individual biomolecules for quantification. TIRFM has the advantage of delivering high contrast images and has become a standard method for the optical detection of single molecules. Here TIRFM is presented as a method to determine the concentration of molecules in solution by correlating digital counts of single fluorescent molecules immobilized on a TIRF probed surface.  The luminescent reporters used in this project are quantum dots (QDs), semiconductor nanocrystals known for their remarkable brightness and stability. Despite the numerous outstanding photophysical properties of QDs, observations of single QDs also display a pronounced intermittent fluorescent behavior, posing a challenge for detecting single QDs. This thesis demonstrates a reliable method of detection taking advantage of these fluctuations of the signal. The quantitative methodology developed here for digital quantification of single QDs enables detection at the sub-femtomolar level, and can be applied to biological applications for quantification of low levels of DNA.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6503a9c553c5e923ed7e3daf74514360"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_aae97ea7087b61fff1f1e5f73e58be05" level="item"><did><unittitle>Partial Synthesis of the Tetrasaccharide Fragment of Arugomycin</unittitle><unitid>UA005.015.019.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Trotta, Adam H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d0fbfc503417b999d50fcbc635e51dc0">Arugomycin is a biologically active natural product, showing both antibacterial and antitumor activities. It intercalates in DNA, binding to both the major and minor grooves. The two oligosaccharide chains play important roles in stabilizing the arugomycin-DNA complex. In recent years the Bennett lab has pioneered a strategy for cyclopropenium cation promoted dehydrative glycosylations of 2-deoxy sugars. With that in mind, a synthetic strategy was outlined for the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide fragment of arugomycin. This structure would be difficult to access using traditional glycosylation methods, highlighting the utility of the cyclopropenium cation methodology.
\
  The synthetic strategy revealed a common intermediate in the synthesis of all four monomers. The common intermediate was successfully synthesized. Three of the four monomers are functionalized with a methyl ether at C-3. Regioselective alkylation of the diol intermediate proved difficult, delaying the synthesis considerably. After several attempts at methylating the fucal, a new synthetic strategy was devised. Regioselective methylation was successfully completed on a 2-deoxy-fucopyranosyl derivative.

The rate-limiting step of this reaction is the cleavage of a carbon-hydrogen bond in methane to form surface-bound hydrogen and methyl (CH3) fragments. This thesis describes eigenstate-resolved molecular beam-surface scattering experiments of vibrationally enhanced methane dissociation on both the (111) and (110) faces of an iridium single crystal. These experiments revealed different reaction pathways available when a vibrationally excited methane molecule interacted with iridium. On a hot (1000 K) Ir(111) surface, two reaction pathways were observed. At high incident translational energies, the direct (single collision) dissociative pathway dominated, while at low incident translational energies, a precursor trapping-mediated pathway dominated. A shift in the reaction probability curve in the direct channel was observed when comparing reaction probabilities at v=0 (the vibrational ground state) and v3. This shift indicated that the 36 kJ/mol of vibrational energy in the 3 C-H stretch (Seets et al, 1997) was about 0.46 times as effective as translational energy in promoting methane's dissociation via the direct channel. In the precursor mechanism, v3 excitation led to an approximately six-fold enhancement in reactivity. Ir(110) has a lower average barrier to reaction, approximately 35 kJ/mol (Seets et al, 1997), and both direct and precursor-mediated channels at surface temperatures of 1000 K and 500 K were observed. Vibrational energy was about 0.86 times as effective as translational energy in promoting direct dissociation of methane on 1000 K Ir(110), suggesting that vibrational energy is more effective at promoting activation in the direct channel on Ir(110) than Ir(111), regardless of surface temperature. There was less of an immediate decrease in the contribution of the trapping-mediated regime to reactivity on 1000 K Ir(110) with increasing translational energy, indicating that the trapping-mediated pathway was more pronounced on Ir(110) than it was on Ir(111). While the trapping pathway had a minimal effect on reactivity on 500 K Ir(110) when the methane molecules existed in v=0, it contributed greatly to reactivity when the molecules were excited to v3. These experiments reveal mechanistic insights into the rate-limiting step of the steam reforming process. Future studies will include finalizing the Ir(110) reaction probability curves at higher translational energies in order to further study the effect of vibrational enhancement on the direct mechanism of dissociation, purchasing a new laser system to excite methane molecules into higher energy bending or stretching states, or using a palladium or platinum crystal to act as the transition metal catalyst in order to further study how different metals will affect the different channels of reactivity.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_62be683097007c7e9ad3d419ede814a2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemistry</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5706a391790b0bc62e5c5463ac2fd5c3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Synthesis of a Ganglioside GM1 Anchor for Membrane Tethered Ligands of G-Protein Coupled Receptors</unittitle><unitid>UA005.015.022.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sidhom, Eriene-Heidi</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_07e72a1c7e273c143883d921ead8b945">G-protein coupled receptors, as a class of proteins, are most important therapeutically. It is estimated that over 50% of prescription drugs target these receptors.1 At nearly 1000 proteins, this family is divided into 5 classes, or families. The largest of these is Class A, the Rhodopsin family. This class is identifiable by conserved sequences which are critical for membrane activation. Among these receptors is Chemokine-like Receptor 1 (CMKLR1 or Chem32), which is most highly expressed on leukocytes. Its natural ligand, chemerin, is shown to have chemoattractant capabilities and other pro-inflammatory characteristics.26 However, therapeutically promising are the short C-terminal peptides, naturally derived from the bioactivation of chemerin, which show potent antagonist and anti-inflammatory properties.7 Learning more about this receptor could be important, especially for its therapeutic implications. 	Classically, the targeting of GPCRs has been done through soluble ligands which bind to extracellular orthosteric or allosteric binding sites. However, in 2002, a new method of targeting receptors, termed pepducins, was presented by Covic et al.8,9 They targeted various Class A GPCRs by taking advantage of the critical third inner loop which shifts significantly during activation due to movement of the sixth transmembrane domain.1012 The method was reliant on the usage of palmitic acid to tether the peptide to the plasma membrane and localize it specifically to the cytoplasmic leaflet. This concept of membrane-tethered ligands was applied to the extracellular leaflet in 2009 by Fortin et al., in which they targeted Class B GPCRs using peptide anchors mimicking the transmembrane domain of GPCRs to ensure accurate polarity.13 They later moved to a lipid anchor, specifically GM1.14 	Here, we present the synthesis and purification of a maleimide functionlized GM1 (mGM1) on the terminal sialic acid from natural GM1. Additionally, the synthesis and purification of a biostable chemerin peptide (sChem9-PEG8-MPA), linked to a polyethylene glycol polymer (PEG8) and functionalized with a thiol, to be reactive with the maleimde on GM1. Future experiments will need to optimize the reaction and purification of the mGM1 and sChem9-PEG8-MPA. Following successful purification of the compound, cell experiments using a luciferase assay and cells expressing CMKLR1 can determine the efficacy of the GM1-tethered ligand versus soluble ligands. If this method can be generalized to targeting other GPCR receptors it could potentially be a valuable therapeutic and investigative tool.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7627cbe23db4b1a52d07ab24282f7338"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Chemistry</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a2907b5b8ca337cce53ccd19326a344e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards the Directing Group-Free Synthesis of the S. pneumoniae Serotype 6B Capsular Polysaccharide Minimum Repeat</unittitle><unitid>UA005.015.023.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Touchette, Samuel J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c6479c188df18c83e7dd14da8e41cfd4">The syntheses of the 4 monosaccharide components of the minimum repeating unit of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6B capsular polysaccharide are described.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_93d18fac79e68ee6d6b94ad0dcd80d61"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Integrating a photo-responsive moiety into the PT derivative allows for light to be used to disrupt the electrostatic interactions in the film, resulting in control over solubility of the film. The fabrication of these
                                photo-responsive PT films is sought after in hopes of creating an organic semiconductor that is also a positive photoresist, meaning it is amenable to patterning using photochemical processes such as photolithography.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_af77efc4d916025df7f34a8f4b34817d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

This study looks to bridge the gap by examining the history of children's book-to-film adaptations, media and child development theories, and media literacy on a wider scale. Through discussions with top media and publishing executives, we learn the general attitudes of each industry and how they work together. From these expectations we can learn what the future might hold and how it can be changed to better suite a growing audience in this genre.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_45f9fc6dd75691a8463090241745cc8c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Plan of Study</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6e27b9e7ed2cb8ce341a1e3e73a2aa58" level="item"><did><unittitle>Establishing the Moral Authority of Formal Hospice Care in China: A Case Study of the Songtang Caring Hospital</unittitle><unitid>UA005.016.097.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Prueher, Lillian K.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e12e9a62016ca8290d9a8a22aed577d4">This thesis is based on research conducted at China's first formal hospice hospital - the Songtang Caring Hospital in Beijing- during the summer of 2011.  Incorporating interviews with doctors, nurses, and primary caregivers at that hospital, as well as over 40 hours of participant observation and analyses of a hospice textbook used by medical practitioners at that facility, this thesis examines how formal hospice care has been interpreted in a Chinese cultural context; specifically, how the Songtang Caring Hospital's approach to hospice care is constructed around a series of direct and indirect attempts to establish formal hospice facilities as moral institutions.  Those attempts are examined on theoretical, institutional and individual levels, as revealed through discussions of formal hospice care in hospice texts and descriptions of the Songtang Caring Hospital given by the people working there.  The theoretical understanding of formal hospice care at the foundation of this thesis is then complicated by examining its effects on the organization and management of the Songtang Caring Hospital on an institutional level.  Finally, that institutional understanding of formal hospice care is then further complicated by exploring how real-world factors and the subjectivities of both caregivers and patients influenced formal hospice care at the Songtang Caring Hospital on the level of individual caregiver-patient interactions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9e407988395a65d442c17455e2faae77"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_78d1023c396c9d99d2388e9f79e972b6" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Impact of Information and Communication Technology on State Sovereignty: An Analysis of the Cyber Utopian and Cyber Skeptic Perspectives</unittitle><unitid>UA005.016.098.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mishra, Sara B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e6111a0dd245b5d771565ca130b041e9">In the past few decades an information revolution has swept the globe, and affected the lives of billions of people. The concept of globalization has taken root in the minds and writings of academic scholars, government officials, industry professionals, and even average citizens. The trend of increased interaction between individuals across national borders has been enabled by a long series of developments in transportation and information communication technologies (ICT). However, in recent decades there has been an increased focus on the role of ICT networks in connecting people around the world, specifically without the assistance or interference of their respective governments. Many individuals are inspired by the potential of these new technologies to allow for an unprecedented scale of international interaction. These "cyber utopians" see these ICT networks as facilitating a fundamental shift in how people organize themselves and the very fabric of governance. However, there are also individuals who argue that these recent ICT advances are just an extension of similar technological developments in the past. These "cyber skeptics" believe that in time the impact of ICT will be subjected to the rule of governments, and even become a useful tool for state control. At the core of the debate between these conflicting perspectives is the question: How are ICT networks impacting the sovereignty of states? The discussions in this analysis will not attempt to fully answer this question, but will seek to explore the theories that define "state sovereignty", and the contrasting perspectives on how it is being challenged by the decentralized nature of ICT networks. This analysis will address the two main questions: What are some of the functions of ICT networks that allow citizens to challenge the authority of the state? What are some of the functions of ICT networks that allow states to reassert their authority? And it will discuss, but by no means fully answer, the third question: "What challenge does the decentralized nature of ICT networks actually present to state sovereignty?" This analysis will take the theories and thoughts discussed by the cyber utopians and cyber skeptics and apply them to numerous case studies that illustrate the functions of ICT networks. In this way, there will be a comprehensive discussion of the challenges to and reassertions of state sovereignty. This will inform the author's own argument, that while ICT networks do not eliminate state sovereignty, they challenge states' control over actors within their borders. As a result regimes need to more actively reassert their authority in order to retain power, yet state sovereignty, as a whole still remains intact.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_31a2b56aab4971fe207705cc034bbafe"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e39fcc3270ad92643fe9f76cdbaaa78f" level="item"><did><unittitle>The role of network structure in the central nervous control of caterpillar crawling and casting</unittitle><unitid>UA005.016.099.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ewing, Elise M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8834e5f51765bdca085cd824a68f4ae6">Through numerical simulation, this study aims to understand a neuronal network that could be responsible for controlling several different behaviors of the caterpillar Manduca sexta, in hopes that the knowledge gained will be applicable to crawling in other caterpil- lars and soft-bodied units in general. Knowledge from previous studies has been compiled in order to determine target output patterns for our networks. Qualitatively, the crawling pattern consists of a slow posterior to anterior propagating wave of bursts of activity within the ganglia of the abdominal body segments in Manduca. Another behavior that we con- sider is casting, which is a side-to-side motion believed to be a searching behavior. This behavior is characterized by laterally anti-synchronous bursting within a ganglion that is concurrent in successive posterior and anterior ganglia. One side of the caterpillar is active, and then the other. Working from simple feasible network designs, simulations were run in order to determine parameter regimes where our network could produce different desired outputs. We have found that a bilateral network of inhibitory neurons with adaptation cur- rents can produce either synchronous or anti-synchronous behavior when stimulated under different initial conditions. We have also found that the slow anterior propagating wave of the crawling pattern can be produced in a network of anterior linked excitatory neurons if those neurons release neurotransmitter that persists for a relatively long time in the synapse, and each neuron is self-inhibited by an adaptation current that acts on an even slower time scale.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_24715bb0f2e0d5a5004c3571d86cc456"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cb03af3a5e5cb9fbe21ab12ac2989d1c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Environmental Justice Considerations in New York City: The Racial Disparities in Adverse Birth Outcomes, Air Pollution, and Public Housing Developments </unittitle><unitid>UA005.016.100.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Goldberg, Rebecca D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a3d87d773553c793fec093bb5bcdae6b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_327676195a4309a995a3a9edc482ccb6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This thesis argues that there are structural and systematic connections between history and geography that create and influence the differences between the lived experiences of Black people living in the U.S. and those of White people living in the U.S. The patterns of residency that occur in the U.S. have a historical context, and it is vital to understand this context in order to understand the distribution of demographics that we see today: race, socioeconomic status, health outcomes, etc. The history of Black people is at the root of how racism formed and took shape in America. By using public health data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this thesis explores the importance of history and race, and what contribution these two factors might have towards generating the pattern that we see in adverse birth outcomes today. This thesis covers the topics of history of New York City, racial disparities in health, adverse birth outcomes and air pollution
                exposure, and environmental justice. I argue that the racial disparities we see in exposure to air pollution and incidence of adverse birth outcomes are due to institutional and environmental racism that persists today.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

The premise is that wasei eigo exemplifies Japan's relation with foreign things and concepts, especially Western ones.  It takes them in and then transforms them into something different, yet better suited and more accessible, to Japan and its people. It is an example and paradigm for many kinds of cross-cultural and cross-linguistic contacts and borrowingof words and grammar, food, holidays, music, and more. The paper gives an overview of the history of Japan's contact with foreign language, as well as explanations of several types of wasei eigo, then discusses reasons for its existence and use, and puts it in a broader context with comparisons to modified cultural traditions as well as to other forms of linguistic borrowing.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_93e3191d32fdb7573745ba42e1cf4ccb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in Asian Studies</subject></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_95a1418c8249eabb49d8b783c60366a2" level="series"><did><unittitle>Africa and the New World</unittitle><unitid>UA005.018</unitid><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 Volumes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2000/2012" type="inclusive">2000 -- 2012</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_764147297e8be1a7ed363c7fde87206d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Undergraduate honors theses from the Africa and the New World minor.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7d6720d58e09f3da8f9a1cc2bdd6458f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_5f9b98550dbd3765252d8cf3c6cdc851"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_0964c38075f2c783532e398005ccd01a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Returning Through the 'Door of No Return': A Case Study of African-American Repatriation to Ghana, 1945-1999.</unittitle><unitid>UA005.018.001.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Markle, Seth M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2000/2000">2000</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_63372093586384d282bb2546728fceef" label="Books [39090011154206b]" type="box">Volume 1</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d229b376e32ebffcda5e689a804a96fc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Africa and the New World</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bf95176a508bd9d3b4bc6dc64615d597" level="item"><did><unittitle>Stronger than the Hippocratic Oath: HIV and Hunger in a State of Denial</unittitle><unitid>UA005.018.002.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Carpenter, Sarah Elizabeth</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b8b6699441f2d113cad42b4a7762a7d4">South Africa's former president Thabo Mbeki responded to the HIV epidemic in his country by refusing antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for HIV-positive patients. It is important to ask how the national government responded to the epidemic in the absence of ARV distribution and how this policy translated to the provincial level. As the province with the greatest prevalence of HIV/AIDS, KwaZulu-Natal provides an excellent case study for the comparison between provincial policies and national policies. By comparing speeches, budgets, and government documents from the national government and the government of KwaZulu-Natal, significant differences between the responses were uncovered. It was found that while the national government promoted nutritional programs to combat the epidemic rather than ARVs, the government of KwaZulu-Natal distributed ARVs to provincial hospitals and combined modern medicine with traditional practices to respond to the epidemic. The KwaZulu-Natal government's polices provide an example of a public health approach to an epidemic that married traditionalism and modernism.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ef6bc26f4e5d5dd740972a344f6fd133"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_cbeae3d52db3f69dded78dfc72fb7c1f" level="series"><did><unittitle>Department of Biomedical Engineering</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019</unitid><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">3 Volumes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">32 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2000/2015" type="inclusive">2000 -- 2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8cc0986f6a49bc7c77b3e634a522ac03"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Undergraduate honors theses from the Department of Biomedical Engineering.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_739fe968d8435d0bc6855183baad9a45"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_b6c73164915fd940dcfa622faa74b84b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_9124ddc2a0cb446838394b8f0e8fdcd5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Laminin-induced Enhancement of Biocompatibility in Microphodiode Arrays</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.001.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, Bryan R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2000/2000">2000</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_0c34a6c9ab9a55ed0edc46258b2e1a14" label="Books [39090011154297b]" type="box">Volume 1</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_55f3d51df21616542d679c3a54f8d093"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1bb275e2b61b2c2d30af709f0781389d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Non-linear Optical Biomarkers of Normal, Dysplastic, and Cancerous Tissue</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.002.00001</unitid><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_1e361d802a8f0051d45dd4b0902100a8" label="Books [39090014011965b]" type="box">Volume 2</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1fd948301747cffa3f1c78f856f2d183"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f06090ab3bc1d696ad3ed8a8dfc92d30" level="item"><did><unittitle>Biomimetic System For Inducing In Vitro Neovascularization</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.003.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fallica, Brian</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5b579ee5f744a1bf86d5535e0bf41da1">One of the major problems in tissue engineering that has still to be resolved is the ability to promote vasculogenesis in artificial tissue. Without this capability, tissue thickness is severely limited, preventing the tissue from being used as a therapeutic. Several attempts have been made to overcome the problem, but a more biomimetic approach is required before these systems will work. Previous systems have relied on bolus administrations of growth factors or by delivering a single growth factor from a homogenous scaffold. Results have shown that these methods are unsatisfactory, and a more biomimetic approach is required before these systems will work. More recent attempts, aimed at delivering multiple growth factors from highly engineered scaffolds have shown promise, and this investigation is part of the new wave of vasculogenic systems.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1ea285b32e2bf7f8692747daf2ed914e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_42629a1f64f4b90571e899c82ea954a4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Osteogenesis Effects Of Growth Factors On An In Vitro Osteogenesis Imperfecta Disease Model</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.004.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brandon, Alissa</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b30e37666f013cabd103e526f25edf99">Osteogenesis Imperfecta is a brittle bone disease in which there is an inadequate amount of Bone Collagen protein produced by cells.

The goal was to gain insight about healthy and diseased bone development by comparing results to that of normal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the same scaffolds. Well established qualitative tests and quantitative assays were used to assess the results. These included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the Sircol collagen content Assay. Eventually it was shown that BMP-2 increased collagen production even in knockdown cells. BMP-2 also increased calcium mineralization.

Current clinical methods of treating peripheral nerve damage are not satisfactory. To have more control over regenerating peripheral nerves, researchers are creating nerve conduits. Much research has been done on creating nerve conduits, but poor material choice and lack of growth promoters, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), have inhibited regeneration. Recently, nerve conduits have been made from silk fibroin. There are many methods of incorporating NGF into a nerve conduit. To achieve higher rates of NGF release, the study discussed in this paper analyzed different methods of incorporating NGF into silk fibroin. In this study, a system that can be applied to create nerve conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration was developed by characterizing the release of NGF from a 2D model of a nerve conduit. Silk films were used to model the nerve conduit release characteristics to provide a simpler system for analysis. There were three approaches of incorporating NGF in the silk. In the first model, the NGF was mixed with aqueous silk solution. In the second model, a layer of NGF was dried on top of the silk film. In the third model, layers on NGF were entrapped between layers of silk. All of the methods yielded low release rates of NGF.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_94f5fe823cce778b924c2dfc50c5d8ca"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_81e593289557b825cc08c6c3de86bd68" level="item"><did><unittitle>Bioactive Nanocomposites for Dentinogenic Restoration</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.006.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nadkarni, Lauren</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b838528c174d8745de021629e72a93c4">Restoration of bone after injury is essential. There are two current repair mechanisms, root canals and bioactive molecule implants, both of which can be costly and have inconsistent material properties with the target tissue. Therefore, novel bioactive chimeric proteins were developed containing a spider dragline silk domain for strength and stability and a domain containing either an R5 or A3 silica precipitating sequence for biomineraliation. We hypothesized that the varying number of silk repeating sequences, in combination with each silica precipitating sequence, would differentially precipitate silica and affect the biomineralization capabilities of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in vitro. The protein films precipitated silica particles on the surfaces.  The particles ranged in size from 200-400nm and were separated (as opposed to agglomerated) on films treated with glycerol. hMSCs differentiated toward osteoblasts and deposited calcium phosphate, a hydroxyapatite precursor and major organic component of bone. The cells were viable and showed osteoinductive properties, but displayed inconclusive genetic expression of genetic bone markers (bone sialoprotein, BSP, alkaline phosphatase, ALP, and collagen type I, ColI). Overall, we achieved our specific aims of precipitating silica and characterizing the chimeric protein films based on their sequences and successfully differentiated hMSCs towards osteoblasts that achieved biomineralization.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_397a2c948e866a2e42df1b6fd1d72ddb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_50d810ac41fa8009641191dfe5a40ecb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines on Bone Differentiation and Growth of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sava, Parid</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_6ee23f79f11bbc38a9c9b824899853e0" label="Books [39090015513506b]" type="box">Volume 7</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_527033809f05c2e0d2aa183e9bb39f74"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f4f639c1696cf6809896a177987886e2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Silk Encapsulated Films for Sustained Release of Buprenorphine</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.008.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Engelberg, Rachel Beth</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_bad3f78705839076e006ea2cf22a7f44">A major problem with prescribed medication is patient compliance. In both the medical and veterinary field, physicians cannot be guaranteed that the patient will complete the prescribed regimen due to any number of factors. Buprenorphine (BUP) is a synthetic opioid with partial agonist and antagonist activity at the &amp;#x03bc;- and ORL- receptors and the &amp;#x03ba;- and &amp;#x03b4;- opioid receptors, respectively. BUP is used as an analgesic as well as a treatment for opiate addictions. Most analgesic or addiction treatment regimens tend to be inconvenient as they must be administered repeatedly for extended periods of time for any drug delivery route. With BUP, oral ingestion is not a desired route because the drug undergoes very high hepatic first-pass metabolism. For an oral administration of BUP, the desired dosage for the plasma must be increased tenfold, implying that 90% will become waste. For domesticated animals, there is no alternate route convenient for the pet owner. In humans on an outpatient basis, BUP is administered sublingually. For inpatient animals and humans, BUP can be administered intravenously, three times a day. In order to make BUP use more convenient and efficacious, a construct that will support zero-order, sustained release of BUP over an extended period of time must be developed.  An encapsulated film-reservoir was constructed by infusing BUP within a film made from silk-fibroin. The film was then coated with differing numbers of silk layers to control the release profile of the drug. These film-reservoirs were assayed in vitro via PBS assays. Because BUP is a Schedule III drug and large quantities may not be procured for in vitro use, Indigo Carmine (IC) was used as an analog and underwent the same in vitro assays to demonstrate comparability.  The release profiles were then determined for various mass loadings (0.25 mg, 1.25 mg, 2.50) and various numbers of coatings (0x, 4x, 8x).  Drug release from coated silk constructs was then modeled for zero-order release.  Indigo carmine did not demonstrate a significantly similar release profile to buprenorphine in vitro.  Formulation of buprenorphine used and interactions between buprenorphine and silk require further investigations. Release profiles with increasing coating numbers demonstrated closer correlation to the kinetic model. The release profiles determined with these parameters were purely diffusion-based, however the addition of coatings approached zero-order release parameters when modeled.  Mass loadings formed from indigo carmine in solution at a concentration of 5 mg/ml most closely followed the modeled profile. Films with 8x coatings demonstrated the slowest and most linear release kinetics.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_216d6d746b7e22b096cf233d40f63041"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b32a31f43a370e80fb4432c8ebd69c11" level="item"><did><unittitle>Chlorophyll and Silk-based Oxygen Producing Biomaterials for Tissue Engineering</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.009.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wang, Chin-Chieh Russell</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c8a5a77525907cea427c42fb29f94423">The lack of oxygen is often a limiting factor in various tissue engineering applications. In numerous studies centered on the regeneration of tissues and organs, the lack of oxygen diffusion is often one of the major problems encountered. Oxygen is a vital component in the development and proliferation of cells and vascularization of tissues necessary for tissue regeneration studies. Recent studies conducted to address this problem of oxygen diffusion have been based on the implementation of oxygen releasing biomaterials. These studies were centered on implantable biomaterials that release oxygen over a period of time but do not actually produce it.  This study focuses on the production of chlorophyll-based biomaterials that can produce and release oxygen over a prolonged period of time.  The main components of the oxygen-releasing biomaterials in this study are plant chlorophyll and silk fibroin. In the search for the ideal oxygen producing system for this study, photosynthesis stood out as the most promising candidate. Photosynthesis is one of the most crucial and common naturally occurring processes in the environment. Photosynthesis is the most significant oxygen producing process in Nature and because of this, has been extensively studied. The fact that photosynthesis has been well studied is one of the reasons why it was chosen for the research presented here. The stability of photosynthesis in Nature makes it a favorable choice for the study as well. This study hopes to maintain the stability of photosynthesis in a synthetic environment. The choice of silk as the other main component of this oxygen-producing biomaterial is based on research that has shown it to be both flexible in its application space and biologically compatible. The biomaterial required for this study must be compatible enough to implant into living organisms and have a controllable degradation timeline. Silk fibroin has been demonstrated to be a promising biomaterial because of a number of attributes (Perry 2008). Silk is also believed to be less toxic than most synthetic biomaterials. This non-toxicity will be important in maintaining the stability of photosynthesis in the biomaterials as well as play a role in the biocompatibility of the biomaterial when implanted in vivo.  The goal of this study is to produce a novel oxygen-producing biomaterial by incorporating plant chloroplasts into silk fibroin that will release oxygen for a prolonged period of time. Such a biomaterial could be promising in many tissue engineering applications. In addition to tissue engineering applications, the development of an oxygen producing biomaterial would also have a wider range of applications. Such an oxygen-producing biomaterial can be viewed as a type of 'artificial leaf' that could find applications in fields from bio-catalysis to bio-sensing.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d2ee15216049e8c5bb612d1b7d289f64"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c55042cc8d61b24a94aad1f774e69a5a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Hormonal Control of Manduca sexta Cell Culture for Bioactuator Applications</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.010.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jo, Jonathan Erin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7df47d354ba1774f4592e8ccc670b978">Bioactuators are robotic contractile elements that are powered by muscle cells. The motivation behind bioactuator research centers on the cells' natural contractile properties and the fact that they are a biodegradable organic system that runs primarily on glucose. Current bioactuator research is mainly focused on mammalian cells, but these cells are limited by their sensitivity to temperature, pH, and oxygen levels. Muscle cells from insects such as the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, on the other hand, are better suited for bioactuators as they can tolerate fluctuations in environmental conditions and can spontaneously contract for over three weeks. However, efficient, controllable cell culture methods are unknown. Therefore, the present research focused on developing a cell harvesting protocol to isolate embryonic M. sexta muscle cells and to enhance their development. 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE), an ecdysteroid hormone found during M. sexta development, was added to the media to improve differentiation. A myosin/DAPI immunostaining identified the developing cells as differentiated muscle cells, and the concentration of 20 ng/ml 20-HE was determined to yield the most enhanced differentiation based on its significantly larger myotube width measurements (p&lt;0.001). Methoprene, a juvenile hormone mimic, was added to the media for proliferation assays. A LIVE/DEAD assay indicated that 500 and 1000 ng/ml concentrations were nontoxic to the cells after a 5-day culture. A PicoGreen assay indicated a statistically significant increase in DNA concentrations due to methoprene addition (p&lt;0.05). 500 ng/ml methoprene with 20 ng/ml 20-HE induced the most rapid initial increase in DNA levels during the first two days and was chosen as proliferation media. The long-term developmental effects of this media were determined from a prolonged 10-day exposure, which resulted in significantly less-developed myotubes compared to a control grown on differentiation media (p&lt;0.001). However, switching from methoprene media to differentiation media at day 3 resulted in no significant difference from the positive control (p=0.15). Based on these results, a culture protocol was developed using proliferation media for three days followed by a switch to differentiation media to receive the benefits of both media formulations. These methods were applied to a preliminary bioactuator construct, in which the cells were seeded onto silk or PDMS. The cells differentiated on the PDMS but no on the silk, and they were weakly attached to both materials. Cells were also embedded in a collagen gel prior to seeding, but these cells did not differentiate. The collagen and silk may have interfered with the cells' ability to migrate out of cell masses, which may be an essential part of the differentiation process. Despite the limited success with this construct, it provided useful information regarding future studies and was an acceptable first attempt at a Manduca-based bioactuator system.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2d2413c01751f734f012ee3d8ead4634"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_049ced37d20948aeb0ad0bea5a34cdc3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Examining the Scattering Elements of Natural and Engineered Photonic Crystals Using the Colorimetric Response of Morpho Menelaus Wings and 'Smart Slides' in the Presence of Fluids</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.011.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mitropoulos, Alexander Nicholas</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7b8347dbbe65f5ad92c6d947a09d0af2">Tropical Morpho butterflies are known for their bright blue iridescent colors, formed from an array of scales on the dorsal side of their wings. We present here an experimental study of the wing's spectral response by using multispectral, angle resolved analysis of the wing nanostructure in response to liquids of different indices of refraction and show sensitivity to changes in refractive index of ∆n=0.01. We examine changes in scale number to find an optimal wing size that provides the narrowest bandwidth to be used for an optical sensor design. Individual wings of 4 mm x 4 mm samples were segmented using femtosecond laser machining to produce repeatable cuts to provide information regarding changes in scale number. These results underscore the opportunity to use these natural templates as colorimetric sensors for integration in optofluidic devices while illustrating the structural hierarchy present in the wing architecture in which the overall spectral signature appears as a collective effect caused by the disordered arrangement of individual scattering elements. We hypothesize an optimal structural hierarchy exists in the wing composed of highly sensitive individual scattering elements by monitoring the overall color change observed in a baseline image. Ordered scale portions provided a narrower spectral bandwidth with higher sensitivity, at the area of least disorder, to the same changes in index of refraction contrast. Results show there is a natural tunability of the colorimetric response depending on the number of scales used in each sample. This information introduces an additional variable which can be used to change the sensitivity of natural and engineered photonic crystals. Images taken at individual wavelengths were recorded using a multispectral imaging camera (CRI Nuance CCD camera and imaging software) to measure the peak wavelength response for individual samples after the addition of different oils.  Further investigation with engineered two dimensional photonic crystals was used to monitor the sensitivity for colorimetric detection. The same methods performed on Morpho menelaus samples were repeated on nanoquilt 'smart slide' samples. Results show that both systems have similar characteristics with a linear peak shift as a function of added refractive index making both nanostructures useful for optofluidic sensor designs. However, 'smart slide' samples provide a highly ordered and repeatable colorimetric signature compared to Morpho samples, which, while presenting colorimetric complexity, do not present pattern recurrence between different scales.  The 'deterministic disorder' of the engineered structures allows for the use of multiple scattering effects embedded in the nanostructure to track changes in structural frequencies instead of an overall compound colorimetric response.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2b4c229e9919dd9791d71d909a0e31d4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b88ce20d97853cae97bd408d7cb65bb2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Endothelial Cell Perfusion in a Cancer Model</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.012.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mecham, Cherisse</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4ddd8a65d5ce36b9cf03b2e90055efd2">Cancer research currently relies heavily on in vitro models to study cancer growth mechanisms and conduct initial drug screens.  These models are limited in their relevance to clinical tumors because they lack the necessary integrated blood vasculature for with which to interact.  The long-term goal of this research, therefore, is to develop a vascularized 3D in vitro cancer model that will represent cancer cell-vasculature interactions. This model would allow researchers to study the critical area of cancer metastasis and enable high throughput testing of anti-angiogenic drugs.  To achieve this goal, we suggest combining angiogenesis and vasculogenesis induction methods into one 3D neoplastic cell model.  Vasculogenesis was induced in human microvascular endothelial cells in the presence of neoplastic cells, a feature that had yet to be achieved by those working in this research field.  This was done using Type I collagen gel under static culture conditions.  In addition, a microfluidic device was developed and optimized for the use of establishing dynamic culture conditions necessary in angiogenesis.  The device was further used to show its ability to sustain live cells within the scaffold and our ability to image and distinguish between individual cell types with the device fully intact. This device will be used in the future completion of the angiogenic induction studies, as well as for combining the optimal angiogenesis and vasculogenesis culture conditions into one cumulative 3D neoplastic cell model.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_856e7dbf58b58f12156936e6786da8a2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0877b089b9b770696f0f4859e83dbc66" level="item"><did><unittitle>Correlates of Quality of Life and Functional Disability in Body Dysmorphic Disorder</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.013.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">LeBlanc, Nicole J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a42522275780397ff1dc43433d80550e">Objective: Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a chronic mental illness characterized by low quality of life and functional disability across multiple domains.  Despite the clinical importance of understanding psychosocial impairment in BDD, there has been little research examining the factors that contribute to these outcomes.  The present study was designed to examine the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of low quality of life as well as work, social, and family disability in a sample of individuals with BDD symptoms. Method: Participants completed an internet survey designed to gather information on demographics, BDD phenomenology, treatment, and impairment.  Participants' surveys were included in the final sample (N=256) only if they had completed all study measures and received a score of &amp;#x2265;16 on the 10-item Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS), indicating the presence of clinical BDD symptoms.  Quality of life and functional disability were assessed with the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Scale - Short Form (Q-LES-Q SF) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Results: BDD symptom severity was negatively associated with quality of life and positively associated with disability in all domains.  In addition, being female, having no medical insurance, being older, having more severe depression symptoms, having more severe anxiety symptoms, and having more body-parts concerns were predictive of lower quality of life. Public medical insurance and more severe depression symptoms were predictive of greater work disability while Asian ethnicity, single marital status, and more severe depression symptoms were predictive of greater social disability.

Many diseases are caused when the interactions between multiple neurons, or a neuron and the extracellular matrix is not working correctly.  Being able to control and examine these interactions in detail could lead to a better understanding of many neural diseases.  Also, we can use the knowledge of cues given by the body to manipulate neuron growth.  This could be used to guide neural growth and have optimal connections between neurons and a prosthetic limb for better control and feedback responses.  We have taken two different approaches to controlling neural growth: chemical and physical cues.  In the chemical cues, we attempted to selectively plated laminin using a PDMS stamp in a grid pattern.  While we were unable to achieve laminin transfer, we managed to create a PDMS stamp in the desired pattern.  We also looked at physical cues such as electric and magnetic fields and grooved silk films.  The strength of the fields and stimulation time were varied to find the optimal response.  A combination of electric and magnetic fields was also tested for alignment.  We achieved alignment at some stimulation parameters, however we did not see any trends associated with longer stimulation time or higher field strengths.  Neuron interaction with silk films depended on the relationship of the groove size to the size of the neural cell bodies, with the neurons either sitting in the larger grooves or on top of the smaller grooves.  Overall, we managed to create a stamp that could be used for further cell patterning and controlled neural growth through physical cues.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5e544e449957a36d93fe7bb70ab889a1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Biomedical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_99633aef5cdcf78a2e8c0bb0c6245f5c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Low Oxygen Treatment for the Optimization of 3D Endothelial Cell Tissue Cultures</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.015.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mijailovic, Aleksandar S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_239737d15d49395c72d4a2729162cf11">Currently, the most salient challenge in tissue engineering is the inability to sufficiently vascularize engineered tissues. Without adequate vasculature, most tissues cannot survive due to lack of nutrient and oxygen diffusion. Thus, the therapeutic capability of tissue engineering remains limited.  A number of studies have shown that mimicking in vivo oxygen tensions (4%-6%O2) promotes proliferation and improves cellular organization of endothelial cells in 2D in vitro cultures (Zhao et al. 2008, Decaris et al. 2009, Zhou et al. 2000). Moreover, one recent study has shown that 5% oxygen pre-treatment increases endothelial cell retention on PET scaffolds under dynamic culture, illustrating the potential of low oxygen culture for engineering vascular tissue grafts (Zhao et al. 2008). In this study, we attempted to engineer a pre-vascularized tissue culture by optimizing oxygen concentration. Through the use of low oxygen (5% O2) environments we aimed to (1) stimulate proliferation and cellular organization of endothelial cell tissue cultures on a 3D porous silk scaffold, and (2) improve cellular retention on 3D silk scaffolds in dynamic cultures. We assessed the potential of low oxygen pre-culture through a series of methods: DNA quantification assays, which were used to monitor cell proliferation; histology and confocal microscopy, which were used to assess cell organization; and real time RT-PCR, which assessed the cells' synthesis of extra cellular matrix (ECM) adhesion proteins, such as CD31, in response to low oxygen.  While preliminary DNA quantification results suggested that a 5% oxygen environment improved endothelial cell proliferation compared to 21% oxygen controls, subsequent studies yielded conflicting results. Studies also showed that low oxygen did not significantly affect cell retention in dynamic tissue cultures, and it did not affect CD31 transcript levels, as compared to 21% oxygen controls. Finally, analysis by histology and confocal microscopy did not show improved endothelial organization between oxygen groups.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6a09a87d1c38b52b0d197b66efa540a8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tissue engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_738624745c1197445a8a5e28214a13ab" level="item"><did><unittitle>Osteoarthritis modeling using a 3D in vitro osteochondral scaffold</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.016.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Patel, Atur Avni</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cd19fa737199aeffcb566f9335b182c8">Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent form of joint disease, affecting millions of people in the US. It is estimated that 80% of the population will have radiographic osteoarthritis by the age of 65, and of those 60% will develop symptoms. Currently, most models for this common, yet complex disease have focused on animal studies. Such models involve inducing osteoarthritis in animals and studying their joints for physical and biochemical changes. Some in vitro models have also been constructed. These models, however, involve using either limited, 2D monolayer cultures or simply extracting animal joints. None of the currently available models give the control, reproducibility, and physiological equivalence necessary for a successful model. The animal models lack control, are expensive, and have limited availability. The current in-vitro models are not much better. They are either physiologically irrelevant (2D models) or suffer from the same problems as animal models. The field is in need of a cheap model that can satisfy all of the necessary requirements. With a realistic and robust model, osteoarthritis research can be greatly accelerated and the lives of millions of people can be improved.  This study was conducted to provide a novel model system that will significantly improve the predictive power and realism of osteoarthritis models. The proposed system involves a 3D, in vitro, bone-cartilage coculture that can reasonably depict native joint structure. Osteoarthritis can then be induced and studied in a highly controllable, precise, and realistic way.  In this study, a potential in-vitro osteoarthritis model was successfully implemented and tested. The model consisted of a novel osteoblast scaffold embedded with chondrocyte alginate beads. Osteoarthritis was induced with the cytokines, IL-1? and TNF-?, which have been shown to play a significant role in osteoarthritis development. Testing concluded that the proposed model with some suggested modifications has potential in simulating osteoarthritis. However, further testing and design modifications are necessary before any conclusive statements can be made regarding the success of this model.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8e9a9605c86c17d6275dec8db5342cab"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Osteoarthritis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b13f064f0354b5307949a105d867ed57" level="item"><did><unittitle>Characterization of Silk-Elastinlike Proteins for Use in Soft Bodied Robots</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.017.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Canter, Brian Spencer</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_665b4d4405373c31ae8e2d21a35bdbf0">There are millions of procedures every year that can be classified as invasive or minimally invasive.  An additional probe such as a soft bodied robot would be of great use to medical practitioners performing these operations.  Such robots are the subject of a project commissioned by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to be used as reconnaissance in urban warfare.  However, if these soft bodied robots could be made to both biocompatible and biodegradable then they would be ideal for use in invasive procedures.  Silk-elastinlike proteins, which combine the properties of silk and elastin, are one candidate to make this happen.  Much of the research concerning these proteins has dealt with their possible use in drug delivery and did not focus as much on production or characterization.  This study aimed to optimize the production of silk-elastinlike proteins as well as characterize the material and structural properties of these proteins specifically their transition temperature, secondary structure, and resilience.  Two different silk-elastinlike proteins, SE 15 and SE 16, were transformed and expressed in bacterial cells before being purified using column chromatography.  CD and FTIR were used to investigate the secondary structure of the silk-elastinlike proteins, while UV-Vis Spectroscopy was used to examine the transition temperature of the materials.  AFM was used to determine the resiliency of the silk-elastinlike proteins.  Ultimately, SE 16 exhibited transition temperature behavior while SE 15 did not.  SE 15 was found to be more resilient than SE 16.  These differences are largely due to the disparity in silk units and elastin units between SE 15 and SE 16.  The secondary structure of both proteins was found to be composed of mostly unordered structures and beta sheets.  While more characterization of these materials is needed before they can be produced to make up soft bodied robots, the results of this study do demonstrate a correlation between the properties of silk-elastinlike proteins and the individual numbers of silk units and elastin units.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a55fb87af42ff35757359b535fea161b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Surgical robots</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_29e763cd71262cd5c691478eef3879e2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Susceptibility to Babesiosis, an Infectious Disease of Erythrocytes</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.018.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wilson, Carrie Haas</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cfe39dc8c8d80b043ba81c67b6e0126d">Babesiosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by the intraerythrocytic parasite Babesia microti. Young, healthy individuals usually experience asymptomatic infection or mild illness, whereas elderly or immunocompromised individuals are at risk for severe disease. In these cases, symptoms and parasitemia may persist for several months. The genetic and immunologic determinants of resistance to B. microti infection are poorly understood. Using the susceptible DBA/2 (D2) strain and the resistant C57Bl/6 (B6) strain, the laboratory mapped the main determinant of resistance in young mice to an interval in the mid/proximal region of chromosome 9. I infected B6.D2 strains that vary by the lengths of their congenic intervals, and narrowed the main determinant to a list of 14 genes. The laboratory had observed that lack of the cd4 gene renders B6 mice susceptible to babesiosis, but that parasitemia eventually resolves. In depletion experiments, I confirmed that B cells are required for resolution of parasitemia in cd4-/- B6 mice, but not in wild type B6 mice. I developed a flow cytometry based assay to quantify IgG subisotypes in plasma samples from B. microti infected mice. I observed that IgG1 and IgG3 are specific of B. microti whereas IgG2b and IgG2c also recognize moieties of erythrocytes. I established that the antibody response is delayed, but concomitant to resolution of parasitemia in cd4-/- mice. I established that B cells are critical for resolution of parasitemia in young, but less so in aged DBA/2 mice. These studies have yielded insights on host resistance/susceptibility to babesiosis.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_660830d640395fd6893f75472ba970ea"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Emerging infectious diseases</subject><subject source="local">Babesiosis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d83ba3afb22486677941cce8f783aae0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Examining the induction of limb regeneration through modulation of stump currents by the sodium ionphore monensin in non-regenerating post-metamorphic Rana pipiens frogs</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.019.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jr., David Patterson Hessler,</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_60e24b5d93af5d23d6f93804cf4e3619">Limb regeneration in mammals has long been a notion better belonging to the science fiction realm than in reality. Humans are able to demonstrate some regenerative capabilities in the liver and in the regenerating fingertips of young children (Illingsworth 1974). Here we demonstrate a study aimed to inducing regeneration of an amputated limb by an adult non-regenerative frog. Regenerative medicine is an incredibly interesting field of research and its potential for therapeutic treatment is unmatched.  While previous studies have focused on electrical stimulation (Smith 1974 &amp; Borgens 1977), we examined a pharmacological means of increasing the stump current. Rana are a non-regenerative species of frog that serve as a model organism to study regenerative growth. Previous studies by the Levin Lab have demonstrated that regeneration in vertebrates can be induced by transient sodium current, specifically by the selective sodium ionphore monensin.  Frogs were amputated at the right forelimb and allowed to fully heal before treatment was applied. The objective of this project was to examine the regenerative abilities of the Rana pipiens frogs in response to monensin treatments in sodium baths. Therefore, this study sought to determine the ability of monensin to induce a regenerative event to post-morphogenic non-regenerative frogs.  Although the study is still at an early time point and full analytical data is not yet recorded, early indication shows that treatment with monensin and sodium is capable of inducing a regeneration event in adult Rana pipiens. When compared to water treated and monensin only treatment groups, the monensin + sodium treatment produced results that appear indicative of blastema formation and propagation. After all growth has halted and animals are sacrificed, histological data will reveal what structures, if any, were regenerated.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9e7837f86bd40546a1f1f2b3bcddf5a1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tissue engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a9eb4b0072db762f94d8a1bb9a5af052" level="item"><did><unittitle>Mouse tail regeneration with Biodome</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.020.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Park, Doo Hyun</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6e943d72f1ccc4ecc8ca76850e180904">Every organism in nature regenerates to certain extent, yet the process of regeneration is still not fully understood.

The Biodome project aims to induce regenerative pathways in an amputated murine specie tail by altering membrane potential and providing external electrical stimulations. Biodome is an apparatus designed to deliver chemical solutions, while enabling electrical stimulations. By altering the bioelectrical signals at the wound, the Biodome project was able to produce preliminary regenerative responses by preventing formation of stratum corneum and promoting bone remodeling.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1712d74ed5febaaa5c2e11a293af2f73"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tissue engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b426558804d4dfe6facc0944fb71fe51" level="item"><did><unittitle>Silk Microneedle Fabrication for Transdermal Delivery</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.021.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hong, Edward James</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_658ae0a8a697b494b12009f6c434b5c0">In light of recent trends towards the development and design of biotherapeutics, silk microneedle technology offers a unique, expedient, and effective means to deliver large biomolecules safely, painlessly, and noninvasively.

Photostimulation techniques can be applied to tissue engineering in vitro to reduce the field's dependency on chemical growth factors by using light to control stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Researchers have previously shown that photostimulation positively affects cell proliferation, extracellular matrix composition and organization, and the rate of healing (de Souza 2005; Medrado 2008; Kushibiki 2009). However, the effects of various wavelengths of visible light on stem cell growth and differentiation have not been previously studied. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were photostimulated with LEDs at wavelengths of 455, 470, 528, 617, and 656nm. Experiments analyzing hMSCs' proliferation and bone differentiation were performed. It was determined that blue light at 455 and 470nm had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and differentiation. Red light at 656nm had positive effects on hMSC differentiation shown by increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium production after two weeks. It was concluded that blue light's higher energy inhibited the cells' metabolic activity, while red light's lower energy enhanced bone differentiation. These positive results suggest that photostimulation can improve the mechanical properties and functionality of bone tissue engineering models.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_aeb913c53020c5c339ab1cc6afe8f1f8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Photobiology--Technique</subject><subject source="local">Tissue engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7ee2eba63520c167da9ef96dc51fcc28" level="item"><did><unittitle>Silk Microsphere Encapsulation of Wound Healing Peptides for Regenerative Medicine</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.023.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kovalenko, Katerina</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b68ce79d470ab3dd5a49ddd5c7f75cf0">Chronic wounds are comorbid with diseases that are on the rise, such as diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis, and as such present a growing problem to the medical community. Although there is a range of treatment options available, from hyberbaric oxygen treatments to tissue grafts, there has been an increasing interest in the use of bioactive peptides, specifically those involved in angiogenesis, for the treatment of chronic wounds. In accordance with this, two peptides were developed in the Herman laboratory,  UN3 and Comb1. UN3 is a peptide isolated from platelet releasate, whereas Comb1 is a combinatory peptide synthesized from the EGF-like domains of fibrillin 1 and tenascin X, two noncollagenous ECM peptides. Both of these peptides have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis in vitro. However, in order to facilitate controlled and predictable release of the peptides they were tested in a silk microsphere drug delivery system. This system has the benefits of being biocompatible and biodegradeable, undergoes processing under ambient conditions, and can be modified to change drug delivery rates. In this study, preliminary evaluations of the release profile of biotinylated-Comb1, FITC-Comb1, and UN3 from silk microspheres were performed, and the bioactivity of the peptides after they were released was assessed with an in vitro tube formation study. It was found that all three peptides showed a characteristic release profile that fit a logarithmic regression curve with high correlation, and that silk microsphere delivery was more efficient for FITC-Comb1 and botinylated-Comb1 than UN3. It was also shown in vitro that silk microspheres loaded with the angiogenic peptides stimulated significantly greater angiogenesis than the serum control at the seven hour time point, as measured by total tube proliferation. Future work should focus on conducting in vivo studies with the silk microsphere drug delivery system and in optimizing the microspheres for more sustained release.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d4271da1981b7c917db357a1e71c3cc0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Drug delivery devices</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cdcd4fe99b0860d14aa86001a8bf3916" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards a Novel Silk-based Biosensing Platform with Broad Biomedical Utility: A Multifaceted Approach</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.024.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brenckle, Mark Allen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_525c794316bc49ed55dd020a389ed00e">As a biomaterial, silk fibroin protein possesses a number of desirable characteristics, including biocompatibility and remarkable strength, which make it ideal for a number of biosensing applications.

One significant challenge for the successful development of large-scale engineered tissue constructs is to ensure efficient nutrient delivery throughout the bulk of the tissue. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a viable method for vascularizing scaffolds so that engineered constructs can be immediately perfused upon implantation.  Methods: Soft lithography was used to fabricate micro-scale channels into a porous silk scaffold. Endothelial cells were seeded within these microchannels and cultured under static and shear conditions for up to two weeks.  Chemical and physical parameters were manipulated and quantitative and qualitative measurements were gathered to determine optimal conditions for channel endothelialization. Quantitative RT-PCR measured the expression of three genes involved in cell remodeling and lumen formation.  Results: Cell growth was observed in all channel sizes using histological and immunohistochemical analysis. After two weeks of culture, endothelial cells still expressed proliferation markers predominantly in the shear culture flasks.  Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the ability of microchannels to prevascularize a porous, biodegradable scaffold.  After 14 days of dynamic culture conditions, the microchannels supported endothelial cell proliferation and stable luminal structures.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0859f390ebec536100c25305ce0b6897"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tissue engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ccdd7cff20b8bc57919b3dbe0a0ab284" level="item"><did><unittitle>Healing in 3D Skin Equivalent by the Induction of a Regenerative Response through the Application of External Stimuli</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.028.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Coonahan, Erin Sutton</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4c36a68629c106a001c4b1b5808c6ae1">Wound healing in mammals is a complex biological process whose main goals are to close the wound quickly, inhibit blood loss, and fight infection. The skin left after a wound healing process will never achieve the same level of functionality or tensile strength as undamaged tissue. In contrast to mammalian models, the wound response observed in some amphibian species results in the replication of fully functional tissue. The goal of this study was to induce, through the application of external stimuli, a regenerative response in mammals to mimic that of regenerative species and provide a new technology for wound care. This study developed a 3D in vitro skin model in which the effects of applied electric fields and membrane potential altering solutions on improved wound healing were assessed. An electrode system was designed to measure relevant electrical properties of the model and histology and wound closure rates were analyzed as parameters for improved wound healing after treatment. Preliminary results proved the model to be effective for the testing of these parameters. Further optimization of these treatments could provide an effective new wound care technology that uses the body_�_s own machinery to provide a simple, yet complete healing of the wound.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fb0e35af635b0fa5b7be2a24f6652305"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_0fb8ae15ee8677c47a49dfed2dc4f772" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effects of the Cardiac Extracellular Microenvironment on the Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.029.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tang, Katherine Michele</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_193edac46f29d352b5af3c2624b45ed7">Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) cell therapy is a novel treatment for repairing and regenerating cardiac tissue post myocardial infarction (MI).  Currently in human clinical trials, the therapy aims to repopulate the infarcted tissue with MSCs and prevent the negative remodeling process associated with MI.  However, the treatments are limited by a lack of cell retention and differentiation to cardiomyocytes.  Therefore, this study aimed to determine how the extracellular microenvironment, including the composition and elasticity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and oxygen content, affect the differentiation of MSCs.   MSCs were grown on polyacrylamide gels, representing three physiologically relevant stiffnesses, combined with complete ECM composition or a single purified extracellular protein in order to study the effects of the ECM composition and stiffness on MSC differentiation.  This method of differentiating MSCs was compared to the standard chemical method for cardiac differentiation: treatment with 5-azacytidine.  Then, a disease model was developed to study how changes in stiffness, ECM composition, and oxygen content as a result of MI impact the differentiation of MSCs compared to a healthy cardiac environment.  We found that the physiologically healthy stiffnesses tended to promote differentiation when combined with complete ECM.  Furthermore, the disease model confirmed the results of the cell therapy clinical trials, where the healthy models better differentiated MSCs compared to the infarct model.  However, it was also found that despite hypoxia being a result of MI, it promoted differentiation except when combined with infarct stiffness and infarct ECM composition.  Based on these results, MSCs can be differentiated towards cardiomyocytes if given the appropriate environment, which can lead to improved methods of pre-differentiating MSCs prior to injection in cell therapy for more effective MI treatments.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_db7072edfa6e8dcb63cd86871792ca4b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_900ced8476878947aece2a82b67982ed" level="item"><did><unittitle>Functionalized Glucose Oxidase Silk Films as a Platform for Selective RFID Functionalized Glucose Oxidase Silk Films as a Platform for Selective RFID Glucose Sensing</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.030.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Siebert, Sean Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a92f967861f55e15f18434919279162c">RFID coils are commonly used electronic devices that interact with incoming electromagnetic waves in a way that modifies the output signal. Each coil system has distinctive modulation patterns depending on the overall geometric structure and material properties of the coil. Researchers have previously demonstrated that RFID coil systems can be repurposed as sensor systems by monitoring the change in the coil_�_s signal output as a result of changing environmental conditions (Saremi-Yarahmadi, Murphy, &amp; Toumazou, 2010), (Tao, et al., 2011). However, these systems lack the ability to differentiate any individual variety from another and this lack of specificity hugely decreases their potential functionality. In this dissertation, experiments were conducted to examine the potential of enzyme functionalized silk films as a substrate for RFID coil sensor systems to increase the specificity of detection. It was determined that by locally containing a glucose oxidase solution in direct contact with sensing RFID coils that the concentration of glucose could be successfully detected by monitoring the gradual change in the magnitude of S11 reflection log mag response over time when directly compared to the concentration of fructose solutions. Additionally fabrication methods were determined to generate consistent RFID coils on silk. These combined results suggest the potential for a wide range of enzyme doped silk film sensor systems capable of monitoring the concentration of a wide range of molecules in solution.

This technology could be beneficial in ensuring the health and performance of athletes, who are at high risk for dehydration due to increased fluid losses through the sweat during training and competition. Even at low levels, dehydration causes excess stress to the cardiovascular system and impairs both physical and cognitive performance.  Current methods for monitoring hydration include urine analysis, plasma osmolality, and body mass tracking, yet these methods are limited in their ability to provide information on water and electrolyte losses with instant feedback accessible during activity. This project focuses on the development a wearable device to monitor local sweat losses from the surface of the skin in real-time using a radio frequency identification (RFID) sensor to wirelessly transmit information to a nearby reader. A skin patch for sweat collection was designed by testing the absorption and moisture transmission properties of absorbent cellulose pads and selecting a material to match expected sweat rates without altering secretion from the glands. Subsequently, a passive RFID tag was integrated with the proposed skin patch and the tag antenna was interrogated with a reader during fluid absorption. As conductive fluid accumulated within the patch, an increase in the tag capacitance due to the high dielectric properties of water caused a steady decrease in the center frequency of the reflective power losses. These results demonstrate the ability to detect the volume of conductive fluid collected within an absorbent patch, which could be used to measure the local sweat rate with wireless feedback in real-time. This information could be used to guide fluid and electrolyte replacement to prevent dehydration and maximize athletic performance.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b7469e795fddda04620ad42ba538f1fc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_26037d77e37d6ca27a728c737f935c0d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of Varying Thrombin and Calcium Concentration on the Structure, Mechanical Properties, and Cellular Compatibility of Fibrin Gels</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.032.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wang, Rebecca</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_221b68899a22f0a1140d8c082831c81d">The creation and subsequent implantation of engineered heart tissue (EHT) serves as a promising treatment of complications resulting from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although fibrin gels have previously been used as scaffolds for EHT, little is known about the effects of changing concentrations of reagents during their formation on their ultimate usability. Ultimately, we wish to develop a formulation that accurately mimics the mechanical properties of native heart tissue and allows for optimal attachment, proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition of cardiac cells. To work towards this long-term goal, this study aimed at measuring the effects of varying reagent concentrations, such as thrombin and calcium, on the structure, mechanical properties, and cellular compatibility on fibrin gels. In this study, independent experiments were conducted to determine the effects of varying reagent concentration on each of these parameters. We determined that increasing the calcium concentration within the gel led to an increase in fiber diameter and a decrease in individual fiber density, while increasing in thrombin concentration led to a decrease in fiber diameter and an increase in individual fiber density. In addition, we found that formulations leading to intermediate fiber diameters also gave rise to gels that were the most mechanically robust. Finally, although cells were able to adhere to and proliferate on fibrin gels created under all formulations, we determined that cells exhibited the greatest collagen deposition when grown on gels with small fiber diameters and high individual fiber densities.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_892cb7bf9c42288822788bdde9b542a7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_fcb003a677c06e6bf251262eaaf62a8b" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effects of Electromechanical Stimulation on Myocardial Constructs</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.033.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Boutin, Kyle George</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a99ee877859e5701faaebe4aab86e368">Cardiovascular disease causes artery walls to thicken via the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque. This plaque buildup may block coronary arteries, causing myocardial infarctions and eventually heart failure. The most effective treatment for these problems is full heart transplant, but there are simply not enough resources to carry out this procedure for every case. Cardiac tissue engineering is a potential treatment that solves this resource problem. Many groups have already begun to research tissue engineered myocardium. Since the myocardium tissue of the heart is influenced by mechanical stimulation from blood that fills and stretches the ventricles and electrical stimulation from the electrical conduction system of the heart, many researchers have looked at both mechanical and electrical stimulation. They have each shown improvements in the cardiac function of constructs. The combination of electrical and mechanical stimulation better mimics the environment in vivo. We believe that conditioning myocardial constructs in an environment in which combined mechanical and electrical stimulation are both present in a way that mimics the environment of the heart in vivo will improve cardiac function further. In this report, we establish that electrical stimulation has a greater positive effect on myocardial constructs than mechanical stimulation in terms of twitch force, force per cell, cell alignment, cell connectivity, and cell communication and that there is a relationship between the twitch force of a electromechanically stimulated construct and the delay time between the applied mechanical and electrical stimulation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0b77aee4e96fa06e0be74dcacb2611ff"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_0acbe876aef520c44f48dd2bd824a438" level="item"><did><unittitle>Bioengineered Rat Kidney Tissue Model for Drug Toxicity Assessment</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.034.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Parisi, Erika Joy</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e07267430967893ab87aa8fd41453d91">Nephrotoxicity is induced by a variety of marketed pharmaceuticals, and kidney toxicity is one of the main reasons for failure in preclinical safety trials. The launch of a novel drug on the market has proven an extremely time-consuming and expensive endeavor; therefore, innovative pre-clinical assessment methods are urgently required in order to better screen for more promising candidates. The development of a novel technique for the construction of a sustainable 3D rat kidney model upon which to evaluate the nephrotoxic effects of select pharmaceuticals is reported. Normal rat kidney epithelial and fibroblast cells were cultured in extracellular matrix molecules in order to develop the organ model. The results supported co-culturing with fibroblasts and indicated the collagen-matrigel mixture mediated optimal morphogenesis for both cell types. Structural features of the tubule-like formations of the kidney tissue were validated based on the distribution of GGT-1, Aquaporin 2, and Cytokeratin 8,18,19. Additionally, MTT and LDH cytotoxicity assays demonstrated a severe effect on the NRK52E and 49F cells, especially at 10 uM and 100 uM concentrations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fa793ecde2b9949a7634eab95a73bc9e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_22d25a8e2c8b6d0e8dae1e3719176a8c" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Role of Pathological Mechanical Environment on Cardiomyocyte Function in Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.035.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wang, Raymond</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f6751252b192e3c5ae958a37f0d6bc8e">Left heart hypoplastic syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital heart defect (CHD) consisting of malformations in the left heart causing significantly inhibited blood flow.  Currently surgical procedures have allowed infants to survive this condition into adulthood; however, these surgeries do not restore normal structure or function to the heart.  Although improved treatment is desired, lack of understanding to the cause of HLHS hinders development.  Therefore, this study aimed to isolate the role of the real-time stretched mechanical environment on healthy and diseased cardiac cell development.  The mechanical environments were generated by a custom-built cell stretching device and tests were performed to validate output.  To study HLHS, a nitrofen-induced disease rat model was created and fetal hearts were isolated at various time points.  These hearts were characterized by qRT-PCR and Western blotting to determine phenotypic traits of the disease model.  Cardiac cells from these fetal hearts were then cultured while stretched by our device and analyzed by the same methods.  Based on our analysis, we determined relatively good correlation between the designated parameters and the actual output of the device in terms of membrane stretch and frequency; however improvements could be made.  Additionally, CHD fetal hearts were determined to have shifts in gene expression and protein content related to decrease in contractile function and maturity. Furthermore, culture of cells under mechanical stimulation demonstrated increased gene expression conveying improved functionality and maturation.  However, current incompatibility of myocyte adhesion to the silicone culture membrane under mechanical stretch limited our analysis for specific effects of different types of mechanical stimulation.  Based on these results, application of mechanical cues characteristic of normal myocardial stretch to healthy or diseased cardiomyocytes could be utilized to promote gene expression for improved myocyte function.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a3406249870902e383451db9956ff392"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Biomedical Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9e79828744ebc7fc664b6c191de2721f" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Combined Effect of Mechanical and Chemical Stimulation on the Differentiation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells into Cardiomyocytes</unittitle><unitid>UA005.019.036.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lau, Jason Joseph</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9595f96082039a41c05afb0851aead35">We modified an established procedure used to chemically differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes by incorporating mechanical stimulation and we assessed the early effects of combined stimulation. We designed the Arbitrary Waveform Membrane Stretcher (AWMS) which can stretch the membranes of a Flexcell plate with any waveform including physiologically relevant cardiac waveforms. The AWMS was designed to address limitations of vacuum-based cell stretchers through the use of pulse width modulation control of a moving magnet linear actuator to produce arbitrary waveforms, a feedback system to adjust for changing compliance of Flexcell membranes, and independent control of each plate for multiple simultaneous experiments. To mechanically stimulate cells, we optimized a method to transfer undifferentiated iPS cells to Flexcell plates and modified an existing process that is known to efficiently differentiate iPS cells through growth factor exposure.

The plague was a dramatic event that had a resounding impact on every aspect of medieval society; we are left with descriptions of the experience and reactions to the great level of mortality particularly in the literary and artistic fields. I examine the different ways in which the two prominent Italian authors describe and deal with the psychological consequences in their works, as survivors of the dramatic event. I also explore the changes and repercussions brought about after the wave of plague in 1348.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_adf6b413b4b57fe25effa1562bc68044"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Romance Languages</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b3fa07a352cb188aa6b1954a7b0acb6b" level="item"><did><unittitle>La pesadilla futura de la realidad: Tres novelas dist"picas latinoamericanas</unittitle><unitid>UA005.020.022.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">O'Connor, Rebecca P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8682bae37a6057bce628b414f8f027fa">Este trabajo analizar" algunas caracter'sticas del g"nero dist"pico en Latinoam"rica a partir del an"lisis de tres novelas en particular: Ygdrasil (2005) de Jorge Baradit (Chile), La ley del amor (1996) de Laura Esquivel (M"xico) y Que Dios se apiade de todos nosotros (1993) de Ricardo Guzm"n Wolffer (M"xico).

Por otra parte, la religi"n y la mitolog"a incluyen un elemento persistente que ha existido desde hace miles de a"os y sigue como elemento importante en las sociedades futuras examinadas.

The purpose was to differentiate between a heterogeneous and homogeneous stack model to describe the lamellar organization in PET and to determine the effect of carbon nanotubes on the crystal growth in PET. The nanocomposites contained 2% MWCNT by weight, and were prepared by solution mixing, and then compression molding into film. Dielectric measurements were made at frequencies from 100 Hz to 1 MHz, in parallel plate geometry. Measurements of the samples during cold crystallization (100-120&amp;#x00B0;C) were used to investigate the relationship between the growth of crystals and the restriction of the molecular mobility of the amorphous phase. Results indicate that a heterogeneous distribution of amorphous regions exists, implying both interlamellar and interfibrillar/interspherulitic placement of the amorphous chains. Addition of carbon nanotubes to the PET increased the rate of cold crystallization, but did not affect the glass transition relaxation process.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ea3a7ddbd2ee60035969ef958dde1248"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Physics and Astronomy</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_16b6d74907aecd0bbb97ba6663624ec9" level="item"><did><unittitle>Simulations and Analyses of Expected Nucleon Transversity Measurements in the MINERvA Neutrino Experiment</unittitle><unitid>UA005.022.018.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kehayias, Pauli</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3f7534cc9a7031698e63db4e09453818">Coherent charged current single pion production events were simulated and analyzed for the MINERvA neutrino experiment.

This includes both giving fibres new properties as well as enhancing pre-existing ones. These can be done by altering the dimensions and geometry of the fibre or by changing the media in and around the fibre faces. This thesis explores all of these aspects: optical components are affixed to the end of certain fibres; heating and pulling is used to affect the geometry of some fibres. All of these are tested and their effects on the fibre are explored.  The first process, silk imprinting, investigates the ability to imprint nanostructures (in this case, a grating) onto the fibre face. This will allow us to imprint periodic or aperiodic structures on fibre faces in a material which can be implanted in the body with no negative effects. Thus, we can implant even fibre optics (coupled with current work in silk optical fibre) in the body without the body rejecting the implant.  Tapering works to increase the nonlinear effects by decreasing the core area. As will be discussed, the core area is closely tied to the nonlinear effects in the fibre. Furthermore, if the nonlinear effects can be generated with shorter amounts of fibre, then a supercontinuum source can be made entirely out of fibre and therefore can be portable.  Tweezing beads into an optical fibre introduces a periodic glass structure into the end of the fibre. This could allow us to tune the spectrum coupled into the fibre. Furthermore, the ability to tweeze into the fibre core would mean that other materials could also be tweezed to affect the light traveling through the fibre.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f072398a0a6bd3f94bd2e2bd30236512"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Physics and Astronomy</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1becc89db352b0e63f9801e3de6bfb5a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Crystal Ordering of Isotactic Polypropylene and Carbon Nanotube Composites Under Shear Stress</unittitle><unitid>UA005.022.020.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Judith, Robert Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ee1f477319e7c6fcffab581a47ebad10">CNT/iPP nanocomposites were made from solution of iPP/MWCNT in p-Xylene, at nanotube concentrations of 0.01%, 0.1%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 5.0%, MWCNT by weight, and then dried to form a powder. The powder was then compression molded into a film.  The CNT/iPP composite films were then melted in a Linkham shearing stage, and sheared at 1600C at 1 Hz for 2 seconds.  Polarized optical microscopy (POM) shows that after crystallization and subsequent reheating the sample birefringence survives beyond the standard melting temperature of iPP.  The crystallized sheared films are then analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), microscopic transmission ellipsometry (MTE), and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS).  WAXS scans show formation of ordered crystals consistent with the monoclinic alpha phase of iPP. MTE scans of the sample immediately after shearing and after crystallization confirm the ordering shown in the WAXS scans. DSC scans show a shift in the crystal melting endotherm to higher temperature with increasing CNT concentrations as well as a smaller second endothermic peak that shifts with CNT concentration. We conclude that CNTs increase the crystal ordering in the sheared samples up to a concentration of 1% CNT by weight, while also causing a small increase in the crystal melting temperature. The CNTs do not appear to have an effect on the crystallinity of the samples.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_89ad20034924c84c8d262acd9c10c372"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Physics and Astronomy</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c85ee4df62c0c6f78d83f14ed21efb38" level="item"><did><unittitle>Transmitted Ellipsometry and DSC characterization of iPP/CNT nanocomposites crystallized isothermally at 135C</unittitle><unitid>UA005.022.021.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cabrera, Yaniel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6e96d5acbb60c5e22b7649133cd65a63">The purpose of this study is to characterize the morphology and crystallization kinetics of isotactic polypropylene, when it is used as a matrix in carbon nanotube based composites. We study the morphology of crystallization using microscopic transmission ellipsometry, a fast and efficient technique for studying anisotropic organization in polymers (Georgiev, 2002). Polymer carbon nanotube composites (PCNs) are the largest commercial application of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in nanotechnology. Isotactic polypropylene (iPP) is one of the best model systems to study in this field because iPP/CNT PCNs can form alpha, beta, and gamma crystallographic phases of iPP under a variety of crystallization conditions (Varga, 1992) including: nonisothermal and isothermal melt crystallization, shear, stress, and fiber extrusion. We measured iPP crystals growing perpendicularly to the surface of the CNTs. We present data for PCNs of varying concentrations of CNTs: 0%, 0.015, 0.1%, 1%, 2%, and 5%. We complement ellipsometry with differential scanning calorimetry for thermal analysis.

Quasi-elastic neutrino cross sections are mathematically modeled using form factors, which are calculated from experiment. The axial form factor depends upon the axial mass, measured by earlier bubble chamber experiments as 1.026 ± 0.021 GeV. However, recent experiments have measured the axial mass as 1.14-1.35 GeV. This discrepancy may be due to poorly modeled nuclear effects, as bubble chamber experiments on deuterium are less affected by intra-nuclear interactions than recent experiments on larger nuclei. Current simulations use the impulse approximation method to model neutrino interactions, which treats each nucleon as an isolated particle and then applies corrections for their interactions. In this study, a search was carried out for meson exchange current (MEC) events in the MINERvA experiment, in which nucleons exchange a meson during an interaction with a neutrino. Multi-nucleon production is predicted to be a signal for MEC events and was used to find MEC candidates in this study, though multi-nucleon production does not exclusively result from such reactions. These events are ignored by the impulse approximation model, and have not been directly observed in a neutrino scattering experiment. By searching for these multi-nucleon production in both simulated and real data, the accuracy of current models can be measured. Isolating a sample of such events will show that neutrinos interact with multiple nucleons, rather than scattering off each single nucleons and point to deficiencies in the current modeling of intra-nuclear interactions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_22e17f7ff10644e083d02267f7827ab2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Physics</subject><corpname source="local">Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_68fc2aa716b55097e4c3d3ceb5cf9cf5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Using novel AFM lithography techniques to create flexible platforms for biomechanical measurements</unittitle><unitid>UA005.022.023.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rizzo, Daniel Joseph</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2e11ec5745c2b5e4b6a412ddc4117a4c">Here we explore the validation of a novel technique that incorporates both the spatial and force resolution of the AFM with the temporal resolution of FRET.

AFM force measurements may then be performed on these protein patches to induce and monitor conformational changes. This has been used previously to measure the free-energy difference between two stable conformations of Maltose Binding Protein.

We do this by calculating the intraday correlations between a collection of stocks over the past 20 years and the intrahour correlations over a few particular years. Comparing these results to Monte Carlo simulations of a generic condensed matter system, the Ising model, we find that stocks do not exhibit the same correlation features imposed by the dimension of the lattice of the Ising model, suggesting that a measure of distance between stocks does not exist. Rather, the results resemble a Zero-dimensional Ising model. An investigation of the properties of such a model  one that has not been systematically analyzed in condensed matter physics as there is no physical interpretation  will provide several interesting policy implications, including that stock market crashes may depend on market size.

This project studies electrospun nanofibers of polylactic acid (PLLA) with embedded mul- tiwall nanotubes, as well as the case without nanotubes, using techniques in atomic force microscopy (AFM). The distribution of fibers spun on a silicon substrate is observed by means of an optical microscope. The topography of the nanofibers is then studied using AC mode AFM, and physical characteristics such as the distribution of fiber diameters are studied. Next, electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) is used to measure the dielectric properties of the fibers, and using some modeling of the tip-substrate system, a value for the dielectric constant of the fibers is measured, however the model is found not to apply. Accurate knowledge of the AFM-tip physical parameters (such as tip radius, spring constant etc.) is required for precise measurement of fiber dielectric constants. To achieve this, a novel technique is explored to find the tip/cantilever spring constant. Finally deviations from the modeled tip-sample interactions as proposed by this paper are discovered. Transient effects on the cantilever motion as the cantilever measures the edges of fibers breaks the simple harmonic motion analysis employed by AFM. Furthermore, evidence of permanent partial polarization of the dielectric fibers due to the EFM measurement is observed, resulting in long range forces that cause the AFM tip to interact with the fiber even when it is a considerable distance away.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9a9c685ec25097cf28463a264429279d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Physics and Astronomy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_962c857b5684556371ef7ed4c52f0af7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Investigating Charge Transport and Doping Effects of Reduced Graphene Oxide using Scanning Probe Microscopy Techniques</unittitle><unitid>UA005.022.027.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kehayias, Christopher E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9a6dc76d30fe983a62a96234887a0492">Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) is an electronically hybrid material that displays remarkable chemical sensing properties. Presented herein is a quantitative analysis of the chemical gating effects in RGO-based chemical sensors. The gas sensing devices are patterned in a field-effect transistor geometry, by dielectrophoretic assembly of RGO platelets between gold electrodes deposited on silicon wafers. These sensors demonstrate highly selective and reversible responses to the measured analytes, as well as quick response and recovery times. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the doping mechanism, a combined electronic transport and Kelvin Probe Microscopy experimental technique is employed to quantify the amount of charge transferred to RGO due to chemical doping when the device is exposed to several different analytes. We demonstrate that this method allows us to obtain high-resolution maps of the surface potential and local charge distribution both before and after chemical doping, to identify local gate-susceptible areas on the RGO surface, and to directly extract the contact resistance between the RGO and the metallic electrodes. The method presented is general, suggesting that these results have important implications for building graphene and other nanomaterial-based chemical sensors.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7ca90703b024b659704a29c1b0a4cc2b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Physics and Astronomy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f97d972fb94161b9aa871736f6f88de0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Photoluminescence Based Semiconductor Defect Detection</unittitle><unitid>UA005.022.028.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rockmore, Robert S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_50906f1347f621bb042c276ebf074a6e">In this thesis, a characterization system for semiconductor materials was designed, fabricated, and tested. The capabilities of this setup include measuring photoluminescence emission at a single location of a sample, as well as performing spatially resolved "micro-photoluminescence" measurements throughout a region on the surface of the sample. A number of Gallium Arsenide semiconductor samples were examined in order to validate this testing setup. A Gallium

After performing a number of different spatially resolved photoluminescence tests on this sample, photoluminescence blocking features of as small as 10 microns were detected (the smallest of the fabricated features), and the effective focused laser spot size was determined
                                to be on the order of 100 microns. Optimal testing parameters and settings for both standard and spatially resolved PL were determined experimentally. This setup can be used to characterize the relevant performance characteristics, such as material uniformity, defect location, and variations in doping concentration in semiconductor materials for use in photovoltaics and other devices.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8df1a76d2e4bf7c897cd58368cbd9b2d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

several non-fiction books. These books, authored by hard-line secularists and consumed by millions, have made a particularly large splash in the United States over the past five years, sparking a national public debate about God and religion. It is the goal of this thesis to (1) explore the unique ethical convictions of the New Atheists as expressed by their writings and (2) analyze the implications of the New Atheist movement for the American cultural and political ideals of equality, freedom and democracy. In this way, I will be interested in both the philosophical analysis of New Atheism as well as its socio-historical context and significance for Americans, especially women and minorities. On one hand, I am interested in the distinctive set of moral convictions and values implicit in New Atheist literature. On the other, I am interested in the compatibility or lack thereof of New Atheist ideals with the American vision of an equitable liberal democracy where public policy is both reflective of majority consensus and protective of individual freedoms.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e9e73b3f38325773e1e524365b8d6196"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_8acf4f06df7defddc75aea06c91606f7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Deconstructing Shinto</unittitle><unitid>UA005.024.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Johnson, Stephen M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4bbd6268345a7452c9c1face1146ccca"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ed4d88acba173bbd687001aaac78a057"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>While the majority of people understand Shinto to be Japan's 'indigenous, polytheistic, ancient, religion' in this paper I set out to systematically demonstrate why each of these labels is problematic and misleading.

In Chapter 1, I analyze the various influences in colonial Calcutta that would have impacted Bankim, as well as the ways in which new ideas penetrated the colonial milieu and how Enlightenment forms of thought have impacted both the period itself as well as further scholarship on the period. In Chapter 2, I describe the history of the term dharma itself, how Bankim mobilizes the term to fit his own vision of what it should be, and how scholars have misinterpreted his work in a way that erases his agency in the creative construction of new religious ideals. In Chapter 3, I explore the ramifications of Bankim's work for women, and conclude that despite Bankim's representation in his novels of powerful, agentive women, he uses them as tools to advance his vision of dharma rather than as a way to offer substantive change

Contemporary cities of the Greek homeland were in the process of growing from small, irregularly planned settlements into organized urban spaces. By contrast, the colonies founded overseas in the 8th and 6th centuries BCE lacked any pre-existing structures or spatial organization, allowing the inhabitants to closely approximate their conceptual ideals. For this reason the Greek colonies in Sicily and Magna Graecia, known for their extensive use of gridded urban planning, exemplified the overarching trajectory of urban planning in this period. Over the course of the 8th to 6th centuries BCE the Greek cities in Sicily and Magna Graecia developed many common features, including the zoning of domestic, religious, and political space and the implementation of a gridded street plan in the domestic sector. Each city, however, had its own peculiarities and experimental design elements. I will argue that the interplay between standardization and idiosyncrasy in each city developed as a result of vying for recognition within this tight-knit network of affluent Sicilian and South Italian cities. This competition both stimulated the widespread adoption of popular ideas and encouraged the continuous initiation of new trends.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8542fb5df5514188d5aaf6a408bb6516"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Classics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f9f9930d2ea75715a811f72c380cd5fc" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Meal With Mithras: Examining the Role of the Sacred Repast within the Roman Cult of Mithraism</unittitle><unitid>UA005.025.006.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Graham, Anna F.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ff6da21c3722fc132bf4769b3422242e">The cult of Mithraism is one of many mystery cults within Roman imperial religious culture. However, what sets Mithraism apart, and makes it a special interest for scholarly study, is the lack of primary source accounts and textual documents of the cult liturgy, activity, and culture. While many aspects of the cult have been examined by scholars, the repast, an aspect of cult iconography and mythology as well as an actual activity, has received relatively little
                                attention. This study argues that the meal is one of the central aspects of cult ritual activity and therefore that a study such as this one is necessary for better understanding the cult. In examining comparative meal culture, such as elite dining and religious feasts, as well as cult architecture and archaeological material, this study aims to not only define the role of the meal within the cult, but also highlight its importance to cult life and activity as
                                well as looking at some of the specifics of frequency of occurrence and attendance.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d6618c37f860c977737f27174ba668df"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

How then do foreign languages integrate themselves into a distinctly American form (heavily influenced by immigrants) and reflect a contemporary outlook on American culture? Does telling a story in more than one language impact an audience's comprehension of or engagement with a show? Against the backdrop of uses of foreign languages in American immigrant performance from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth century, I explore the use of four African dialects in the stage adaptation of The Lion King (1998) and how Spanish is integrated into the narrative of In the Heights (2008). For each show, I rely on close readings of lyrics and dialogue, primary source documents published about each production, archival materials from rehearsals, and my personal interviews with theatre historians and the creators themselves. In my examination of two musicals that seem completely antithetical, I analyze the use of language in the narrative itself; the effects of second language use on the audience's comprehension; and finally how the language hybridity of each show affects its assimilation into the Broadway oeuvre.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8329648c8bec3796b1429b8ca51fc186"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Musical theater--History and criticism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_62923f534caa25d4987e758dea3add0b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Sustainability in Theatre</unittitle><unitid>UA005.026.016.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bedik, Shai Troy</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2de24906401781fd8f51159934da851d">Sustainability is increasingly becoming relevant to all areas of human activity, not only industry and home, but the arts as well. Theatre is inherently wasteful event. Large sets and costumes are built specifically for a production, only to be thrown out when the show is over. The aim of this thesis is to explore the different options that theatre has to reduce its carbon footprint, its waste, and to promote the process of recycling in the production process.  The first chapter discusses the evolution of the American environmental movement, bookmarked by two large scale media works, Rachel Carson's landmark book Silent Spring, published in 1962 and Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, produced in 2006. Both these works caused a major shift in environmental awareness. Exploring the policies and attitudes over this strain of time will give the reader a sense of where the theatre fits into the larger environmental movement that has occurred over the past 50 years. It will then move to demonstrate where theatre fits into the environmental movement. Theatre is a large industry with the heart of an individual. It is a constantly growing and changing art form and has the power to change in a sustainable direction.  The second chapter is an amalgamation of green theatre practices, from a variety of sources. This chapter includes ideas for going green in set design and construction, costume design and construction, lighting, and theatrical venues. It also contains a detailed look at the Tufts drama department through interviews with the design and technical faculty. This establishes exactly what the department is doing in their specialties, with recommendations on how to improve sustainability in both the short-term and the long-term. The most important changes for each department are; a welding room in the scene shop to work with steel and other metals, special attention paid to dry cleaning for the costume shop, an understanding of how we are using energy for the light shop, and an overall increase in storage for the drama department.  The third chapter traces the efforts of New York and London to promote sustainability on Broadway and in the West End. It includes an interview with the Broadway Green Alliance (BGA), a subset of The Broadway League, an extended look at the Green Theatre Programme in London, and the Arcola Theatre's efforts to build a new, sustainable theatre space. This chapter compares and contrasts two different strategies to change theatre. The first is the grassroots approach of the BGA and the second is the government approach of London. The conclusion is that the BGA, with its grassroots organization, is a more effective method than that of London's. Both these cities serve as a model for other theatres and, due to the large trickle-down effect of theatre; the efforts made in major metropolises will then be seen in smaller regional theatres in the future.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4913f8a7870e84b70c89af5099eaf4fd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject><subject source="local">Theater</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a1386279541165b372a6ea31549dae39" level="item"><did><unittitle>The "New-Queer" Family: An Investigation of Queer Family Values on Stage: 1964-2011</unittitle><unitid>UA005.026.017.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">McDonald, Kevin R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a6266bdb88fd1e6ce3de9fbc15c11f2c">This thesis attempts to define and explore what "family values" look like in a queer context on stage from 1964 to 2011.

It is at once the most ancient and most immediate of art forms, one that is defined by its connection and interaction with the body. In this sense it is inescapably political, its meaning bound to the possibilities of the body it lies on. Indeed, the fate of the body is often bound to the jewelry. This paper aims to look at gender and jewelry in order to gain some understanding into how jewelry is constructed by and constructs not just a single society, but human societies. It will explore how societal traditions that have sprung up around jewelry and ornamentation have affected the possibilities available to women, determining which have served women well and which are constrictive and destructive.  I contend that not all forms of ornamentation and jewelry rely on the construction of to-be-looked-at-ness, that there are rather several overlapping motivations that function to situate the wearer in society, alternately broadening and limiting the social options available. Jewelry is not only a symbol, but often the means of determining the possibilities of an individual's course through life and through a specific society. I would argue that while many cultures have indeed constructed gender to function in an active/passive dichotomy as delineated by Simmel, it is fully a construction, a performance of acceptable gendered characteristics rather than a reflection of men or women's essential nature. Additionally, the passive connotations of to-be-looked-at-ness can be fought and overcome through traditions that privilege the wearer over the viewer of jewelry, the erstwhile tool of oppression transformed into a method of resistance. I aim to show how these shared motivations can be understood as distinct frames for understanding the social function of jewelry across different cultures and time periods. More than one frame may be applicable in a given locus of tradition. I propose that jewelry can function as a means and symbol of physical incapacitation and ownership, a representation of wealth or honor, and a means of physical and conceptual emancipation. This study also examines the work of contemporary jewelers creating feminist jewelry, including my own</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_afaefdab11d21f1de9e0ae606e7ee77e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Women's Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_651bf858b74b498faec4a626933aa248" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Development of Femininity and Womanhood in the Veiled Prophet Debutante Ball of St. Louis, Missouri: A Critical Analysis</unittitle><unitid>UA005.027.003.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chambers, Nora Catherine</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ba69dca3fa896f6eab3a053daa2a16f9">This thesis examines the social and cultural implications of a debutante ball that takes place annually in St. Louis, Missouri. The ball is run by a men's social organization and because of this, an interesting power dynamic is created between the men in the organization and their daughters, who participate in the ball. Through personal interviews and scholarly research, the effect of the ball on these women's lives at this time is central to my analysis. Why do women still participate? What does it mean to them? What does this say about their families and social location? How does their participation fit into the contemporary feminist discourse?</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8a56c2c04c2e8d6596e38262aaf2e3db"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Debutantes</subject><subject source="local">Young women--Social life and customs</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cbecc5fc86ec2df0345f4bb4c71aedb3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Intersex in Context of White Colonization</unittitle><unitid>UA005.027.004.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Strelevitz, Taylor M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c62d025987d46f9fcc7d04836daf682b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_34cbd228c1d9728ae270843e50fad241"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>WGSS Thesis.

presents an opportunity to vastly increase the efficiency of aircraft by decreasing the friction drag on the wing during flight. These airfoils however are much more susceptible to flow separation and stall conditions resulting in increased drag and loss of lift on the airfoil. Flow control represents a possibility to prevent separation on these airfoils allowing them to be used throughout the aeronautics industry. Separation control is achieved by artificially adding momentum to the flow or manipulating disturbances within the boundary layer. Extensive research has been performed investigating the effect of exciting the boundary layer physically or acoustically with mixed success. Significant control has been achieved however with pulses of air injected directly into the boundary layer tangentially with the flow over the airfoil surface.  In this paper the flow control potential of small, pulsed jets impinging on the airfoil surface is investigated experimentally using a wind tunnel. The effect of a single short pulse, generated at several different locations and angles on the airfoil was tested at a separated angle of attack. Using smoke wire flow visualization the effect of the pulse on separation, the wake size and all other characteristics of the flow were determined during and after the pulse passed the surface of the airfoil. The images produced were compared directly and quantitatively using image analysis software. This analysis successfully demonstrated that short duration impinging jets had an immediate effect on attaching the flow, and a long-term effect decreasing overall drag determined from the wake size. Additionally it was shown that the orientation of the jet had a significant effect on the flow behavior, and the shape of the pulse itself. These experiments generated sufficient proof of the efficacy of impinging jets for separation control and determined several highly effective orientations of the jet for as a basis for more quantitative research.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_96493de7abc7dd62282ccc0a3dab6364"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Mechanical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4ef7db919d6739d5b91e12ee2f76d25d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Modeling of Ethanol-Silica Alcogel Drying Using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide</unittitle><unitid>UA005.028.021.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Griffin, Justin Scott</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_23972e992afa495f9a0b93c613bbacea">An important and time consuming step in aerogel production is supercritical drying.  Improved understanding of the process is necessary to accelerate aerogel production and thus make aerogels more economically feasible and their use more widespread.  A model has been formulated which analyzes transport of supercritical carbon dioxide and ethanol within a single pore of silica aerogel during drying and shows that drying is a diffusion dependent process.  Furthermore, this model elucidates the importance of accurately determining the binary diffusion coefficient in the ethanol-CO2 system, specifically its dependence on system composition.  A second model analyzes drying in a sheet of aerogel as CO2 flows through a narrow gap adjacent to it.  This model quantified the importance of ethanol buildup in the narrow gap on the transient drying process, which was shown to be negligible in the parametric range examined.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1cd2bd1c9f301975fb9aa8ae90922b7a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Mechanical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0052ef88110927538f0d2ec2ee48daef" level="item"><did><unittitle>Design and Commissioning of an Apparatus for Evaluation of Data Center Cooling Technologies</unittitle><unitid>UA005.028.022.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Manno, Michael Vincent</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_240fcdcff83fe7fa3bb4826914825a85">A laboratory apparatus was built to evaluate new data center cooling systems of promise. Data centers currently consume nearly 12 GW of electricity in the United States, and this number is expected to double every six years. Nearly half of the power supplied to a data center is used by the cooling system to keep all of the data processing and storage hardware functioning within operating parameters. New cooling technologies, such as hybrid liquid and air cooling systems could greatly reduce the energy consumed by data center cooling systems and improve data center overall efficiency.  Using the laboratory setup, baseline data on air-cooling was collected to be compared with future experiments using hybrid cooling. Five Dell PowerEdge 2650 were cooled with a closed air loop, which was in turn cooled by a closed water loop. A laboratory chiller provided cold water to the water loop. Energy consumed by the servers was monitored and tracked to evaluate thermal losses in the system. Thermal losses were found to be less than approximately 15%. Additionally, an uncertainty analysis was performed on the air-cooling system.  The air-cooling system was completed, and the laboratory is ready to evaluate novel cooling methods such as hybrid cooling.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_89be389fb40be4094edff0c4eb1f3a9a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Mechanical Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_219df11d342da4d25892ee7d452a8517" level="item"><did><unittitle>Evaluation of Pulsed &amp; Steady Blowing Flow Control in a Slotted Leading Edge Configuration</unittitle><unitid>UA005.028.023.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Patterson, Colin Joseph</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f17e21387c5169767552ad038f8ac148">As aviation fuel prices continue to rise, airlines and aircraft manufacturers alike have a vested interest in reducing the fuel consumption of their aircraft. One of the promising technologies being developed to accomplish this is Active Flow Control (AFC). AFC systems are able to deliver the significant increases in maximum lift needed for the takeoff and landing portions of the mission and thereby, giving AFC the potential to reduce the size and number of flap elements required in a high-lift wing configuration.  This study focuses on an AFC system that injects high-momentum flow into the boundary layer from a slot in the leading edge. Testing was conducted in a 14inx14in wind tunnel test section. Lift and drag forces were measured directly using a 6-axis force transducer embedded within the airfoil itself. The airfoil used was a custom profile developed by Northrop Grumman and incorporates a leading edge slot at 3.5% cord. Both steady state blowing and pulsed blowing AFC were tested as part of this study. In each case the magnitude of the momentum injected was varied between 3% and 10% in the steady cases and 0.02% and .1% in the pulsed.  In the case of steady blowing, the study was able to show improvements in the maximum coefficient of lift of as much as 28% with an uncertainty of ±0.018. The steady blowing jets were also able to postpone stall from an angle of attack of 11° to 14° for all C? values greater than 3%. Pulsed blowing jets, on the other hand, were unable to generate the expected increase in maximum lift.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d616d7323f08958cb93f67815d2802b2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Aeronautics</subject><subject source="local">Fuel consumption</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_82648b1dff3246a69cca49aff4304157" level="item"><did><unittitle>Evaporation-Induced Shear Stress-Driven Heat Pipes</unittitle><unitid>UA005.028.024.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Melnick, Corey</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d03a1e39dc1d0a7decc2d13acc5244a9">Heat pipes are used extensively in the thermal management of electronics, due to their ability to transport large amounts of heat efficiently over long distances. However, heat pipe performance is limited by the rate at which its wick can return liquid to the evaporator and by the thermal conductivity of its wick. Our proposed silicon heat pipe design utilizes a super-hydrophobic nanosurface (SNS) in the evaporator which takes advantage of surface tension forces in order to suspend water on micron scale ridges, creating vapor microchannels beneath the liquid. Thus heat input beneath the SNS conducts through the heat pipe base, into the SNS ridges, and drives evaporation at the liquid-vapor interface. A pressure gradient develops as vapor evaporates, forcing the vapor to flow through the microchannels. This flow of vapor is directed in order to exert a driving shear stress on the liquid above it. Thus, an evaporation-induced shear stress replaces the capillary pressure generated by a wick in a typical heat pipe for the purpose of pumping liquid. Thus, the device is named an evaporation-induced shear stress-driven heat pipe, or ESHP. This shear stress scales with the heat flux, virtually eliminating the dependence of the capillary limit on heat flux. Moreover, the sub-millimeter thick evaporator and condenser lead to small thermal resistances, and gravity has a negligible affect on performance on ESHP performance do a bidirectional fluid flow. In this thesis, an evaporation induced shear stress heat pipe design is proposed, a first order model is used to illustrate the benefits, and analytical and numerical methods are used to investigate fluid flow and heat transfer in the evaporator.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3a5a6d8df31b9d3d9eded65c0d3104f2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_a21b3aab4c572953784601a3976b6b8f" level="item"><did><unittitle>In-Situ Adhesive Strength Study of "Oilygel"</unittitle><unitid>UA005.028.025.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Glenn, Matthew</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7e55d52cb59a043117e41e0321f376dc">With the recent rise in offshore oil exploration there had been a demand for a safe and easily deployable method of oil well containment in the event of blowouts and other emergencies. In response to this call Aspen Aerogel has developed "oilygel."  A byproduct of a chemical reaction, "oilygel" forms a semi rigid gel. This gel has exhibited many useful characteristics among which are a high cohesive strength, the ability to solidify in the presence of hydrocarbons, and adhesive properties. To determine the viability of "oilygel" as a successful containment method a rig has been constructed to simulate an oil well cross section and allow for the determination of the adhesive strength of the "oilygel" as a function of surface area. This rig has shown that the "oilygel's" adhesive strength increases monotonically as a function of sample length. As the diameter of oil production casing is more or less constant the diameter of these samples was held constant to maintain the validity of the experiment. By developing an adhesive strength correlation for the "oilygel" it was then possible to determine the appropriate length of the "oilygel" necessary to effectively contain a renegade oil well. Based on a 25.4 mm cross section and a typical formation pressure of 32.06 MPa this experiment showed that the "oilygel" plug would need to be 100.17 m in length. For a typical production casing with a diameter of around 127 mm this length would need to be around 1604.4 m. However, adhesive strength had been shown to increase with the width of the adhered area so this length could be appreciably shorter. Regardless this length is within reason given that typical well bores extend more than 3218 m into the ground.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2e91881756514e0e4ac03e893d43296d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Offshore oil field equipment industry</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4659f086002da24f1308278885e32b55" level="item"><did><unittitle>Ultra-high Temperature Measurement and Modeling of an Induction-Heated Reactor for Rapid Molten Oxide Electrolysis of Rare Earths</unittitle><unitid>UA005.028.026.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nakanishi, Bradley Rex</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3d72db811feb935d4e799c1324a687e4">The extraction of rare earth elements (REEs) from their oxide ores is of growing economic and political interest in the US. The electrochemical process termed molten oxide electrolysis (MOE), where metals are extracted from their oxides using heat and electricity, offers an environmentally-friendly alternative to current methods for REE extraction. In the previous semester, a novel induction-heated reactor was engineered by a Senior Design group capable of supporting the electrowinning of REEs at laboratory scale. A method for measuring the ultra-high temperatures exceeding 2200 degrees Celsius, necessary for REE MOE, has been developed. A thermal model of the reactor was validated by measuring the steady state temperature gradient within the reactor. With this model, the effectiveness of radiation shielding was quantified and the distribution of thermal stresses supports observed stress fracture locations in radiation shields due to steady state temperature gradients. Finally, a preliminary investigation of potential REE MOE experimental methods was completed to demonstrate the electrowinning of rare earths directly from their oxides.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_676f2b0df106c5e695bf98a8be4e05e3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Mechanical Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_aa3dcaf3a52eae96918744c5af7c7906" level="item"><did><unittitle>Integrating Engineering and Literacy: A Seventh Grade Case Study</unittitle><unitid>UA005.028.027.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Scolnic, Jessica M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e0e51810d9161fa4e4266d71b0d94fc3">In recent years, there has been a push to incorporate engineering into K-12 education. However, as K-12 engineering education is still an emerging field, educators are struggling to define what engineering looks like for young students. The Integrating Engineering and Literacy (IEL) project aims to encourage teachers to integrate engineering activities into the literature they are already reading in class.  Previous IEL research has indicated literacy and engineering design can be mutually supportive practices in traditional classrooms.  This case study works to examine the engineering design pathway of one group of 7th grade students identified as having language-based learning disabilities.  This group of inexperienced student designers demonstrates the capability to engage in productive engineering behaviors, as well as utilize knowledge of the story to inform their designs.

Numerical thermal analysis was performed using ANSYS Icepak and COMSOL Multi-physics software. A numerical correlation was established between the heating rate of the reactor and the temperature difference between the reactor and a sample of alumina or silica; this correlation was of the form dT = A e b*T, where A and b are constants determined by the heating rate. A second correlation was found between the maximum temperature difference, dTmax, between samples of silica and alumina and the sample to sample-cup mass ratio, MR, following the function dTmax = 0.0438 MR 2.4073. A third constant correlation was found between heat of fusion, Hf, and integrated area under a melt-plateau curve, A, as a function Hf =0.2983A.&#13;
Two physical tests were performed in addition to the thermal analyses described above. In one test, the functionality of a pyrometer-sight designed to focus incoming radiation from four specific areas was found to be effective by showing clear spacing between four readings. In a second test, a thermocouple-based high-temperature differential thermal analysis was performed. Due to significant and inconsistent errors produced by the coupling of induction field and the thermocouple wire, it is recommended that thermocouples not be used in induction-heated apparatuses for high-temperature DTA in the future.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6ba93e5f2f5066b2283aabe3c64a2a66"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Mechanical Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_973902bf9cb06bd6c3799256b57aeaed" level="item"><did><unittitle>Frangible Glider Development</unittitle><unitid>UA005.028.029.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Vanderklein, Ian A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_645eb4f53bfa753383cb5ce48231b479">There is a demonstrated need for an aerial reconnaissance glider that can disappear without a trace. To fill this need, a frangible glider was developed with a rigid airframe made up of many component pieces held together in compression by a tension member. The airframe can be triggered to fall apart into its component pieces by severing the tension member. The primary failure modes of the glider were identified and a mathematical model of the wing was developed
                                to better analyze these failure modes. The model indicated that tipping failure due to an applied moment on the wing causing separation between the wing and the body of the glider was the most likely cause of failure. Experiments were performed to test whether the model accurately portrayed failure of the wing, and to test the flight characteristics of the glider prototype. It was found that the experimental and mathematical data had similar curves although they
                                differed at what moment caused initial tipping by about 1 lb*in. The flight test showed that many components of the glider can fail to perform correctly and better integration of glider components was necessary.

The LEGO Mindstorms platform regularly causes frustrations for novice students when they are trying to connect and wire the motors and sensor to the intelligent brick with the Technic building system. The new platform was developed as a way of allowing more students to have success in the project based learning environment as beginners by eliminating the need to have an intelligent, powered brick at the center of any robot creation. A pilot study was conducted to compare the new platform to the LEGO NXT when used to complete educational design challenges. Of the six undergraduate and graduate students tested, five participant responded that the new platform was easier to work with. Two case studies are presented
                in the paper, one of a participant with extensive experience with Mindstorms and one of a participant who had never built with LEGO Technic pieces before. These cases work to display the effectiveness of the platform at enabling beginner students more easily and the technology constraints of the platform that limit complexity. There are many engineering challenges such as powering each component separately and creating an autonomous robot of this nature that doesn't need to have a computer controlling it, but feedback from the pilot test hinted at the new design's potential in the educational setting.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

They exhibit a variety of useful electro-optical properties and have found wide use in liquid crystal displays, optical telecommunications, and soft actuators. The speed at which the material responds to an applied electric field (switching speed) is a critical determinant of device performance. To study the spatiotemporal dynamics of LC materials, a novel method combining high-speed imaging with polarized light microscopy was developed, which provides micron spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution. This method was validated by quantifying the switching dynamics of a well-characterized liquid crystal (5CB) in a canonical Fr�edericksz cell geometry. High-speed polarization microscopy was then applied to measure the effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) dopants on LC switching dynamics. CNTs are found to reduce the switching
                speed by about 10% compared to pure 5CB liquid crystal over voltages ranging from 2.5 - 3.5V.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In today's world, new technologies and tools have been introduced into the workplace that transfers mundane and repetitive tasks away from humans to robots. However, current technological advancements do not enable human-robot interactions that meet human perspectives and social, interactive expectations. Thus the goal of this research is to apply human factors principles to robot factors so that robots are considered as end-users during collaborative tasks for optimal human-robot interaction. A survey was released to Tufts University Engineering undergraduate students, and Masters and Ph.D. candidates, where participants were asked to rank and scale design process steps, rank sorting process by feature, and levels of automation within each sorting process step for designing a tool to sort Legos into an NXT kit. Results showed
                priming had an influence on the ways in which participants ranked features in the sorting process of Legos, thus presorting physical feature of categories (i.e shape) of Legos for human condition, while robot and team conditions defaulted to 'mechanical' features (i.e. efficiency, task). Supported by the literature review and interpretation from the data, a list of recommendations was created to highlight how to improve human-robot interactions by introducing 'Robot Factors'. Key Words: human-robot interaction, human factors, robot factors, perception, stereotypes, robotics, tool design.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

form of archaeological sites, historical monuments, and museum collections is an issue that has plagued recent conflicts worldwide, particularly in the four-plus-year Syrian civil war. Despite the existence of international laws and organizations dedicated to cultural property protection (CPP) in the event of armed conflict, there have been many reports of destruction and damage to cultural heritage sites and heavy looting all over Syria. My research covers the most relevant international laws regarding the Syrian conflict, document the damage sustained to cultural heritage, identify the key players and organizations in the conflict, and compile national and international responses. Through my research, I will show that international laws governing CPP in the event of armed conflict and current CPP strategies are too limited to be effective in modern conflicts. By analyzing the
                responses and the theoretical implementation of international law, I have made recommendations to improve CPP strategies and potential remedies to the obstacles facing the effective implementation of CPP law and measures.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Syria--History--Civil War, 2011---Destruction and pillage.</geogname><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

service programs for homeless families in Somerville, MA. Family homelessness in the United States, practically nonexistent before the 1980s, is rapidly growing to be one of the fasted growing problems today. Social conditions including rising poverty, stagnant wages and a steady decline in available low-income housing have placed hundreds of thousands of families at-risk of homelessness. Families comprise 34 percent of the homeless population, the most rapidly growing demographic. As a result of the present economic constriction, even more families are homeless or at-risk of homelessness. With so many families in need of supportive services, it is important to maximize their utilization. Using methods based on a community-based participatory research model, ten parents of homeless families affiliated with the Somerville Homeless Coalition were interviewed to learn of their experiences finding and utilizing homeless services in Somerville. The interviewees provided insight to the barriers families face when trying to seek aid and the facilitators that help them navigate the homeless system. Additionally, it was also found that a disparity existed where government social services were significantly better known than private nonprofit programs. Study results led to recommendations to improve the supportive service system for homeless families, including increasing communication between nonprofit and government service providers, and providing more information of available supportive programs to communities to make services more accessible and available to at-risk families. Additionally, changes must be made to improve the quality of available services; relations between case workers and clients must be improved and an increase in services, especially low income housing, is sorely needed if the needs of homeless families are to be met.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_056233ff244e3115489f8b35dbbd1d10"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Community Health</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9d27830dac00c635ca815ed2847128b6" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Impacts of Chapter 58 Health Care Reform on Immigrant Health Providers in Massachusetts: A Case Study of The Dorchester House</unittitle><unitid>UA005.031.008.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Peltzman, Talya R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_635396a5b52d9bfb541dc0614d4fa988">This paper explores the impacts that Massachusetts' 2006 landmark Chapter 58 healthcare reform has had on community health centers (CHCs) that provide services to immigrant communities. This analysis is presented through an in-depth case study of one such immigrant CHC, the Dorchester Multiservice House, in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Following background sections on immigrant populations in Massachusetts, their health challenges, and on the history of Chapter 58 reform, I present three chapters of analysis to  show how Chapter 58 has impacted the Dorchester House's patients, providers, and the organization as a whole. I find that, at each level, Chapter 58 has posed significant challenges to Dorchester House, which, in turn, have compromised its ability to provide care to immigrant patients. I follow these chapters of analysis, I present a conclusion that links some of these challenges to specific provisions in Chapter 58 and identify areas of recommendation on the topic of how health care policy can be adjusted to better provide equal access to immigrants and to the health care providers who serve them both in Massachusetts and, with increasingly relevancy, in the United States as a whole.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7cb3b0afe1ac895feebf330f5a162094"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Community Health</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b56cb2bcbc29a9a4ee75028216bd80f6" level="item"><did><unittitle>Barriers to Physical Fitness Program Implementation in the Childcare Centers of Northern Manhattan</unittitle><unitid>UA005.031.009.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Morgan, Reed E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4729581cdfc51c909a01da1683dcdda3">The lack of physical activity among children in Northern Manhattan has resulted in an epidemic of childhood obesity.  Due to low family incomes, cultural dietary and parenting practices, and a lack of community resources, for children living in Harlem and Washington Heights their childcare centers are the primary places where they have the opportunity to engage in physically active play.   Unfortunately, not only is the amount of time the children spend at their child care centers in active play not enough, the time they do spend is not being used in a way that is optimal for the children's health. The purpose of this study was to identify the barriers to physical fitness program implementation in the child care centers of Northern Manhattan.  The study utilized both qualitative research methodology, including five in-depth interviews with directors of child care centers in Northern Manhattan, and quantitative research methodology in the form of a questionnaire completed by the same five directors.  The results of the interviews and the questionnaires revealed the significant barriers to physical fitness implementation in the child care centers' communities, as well as the directors' agreement that structured play and organized exercise, as opposed to free play, have greater health benefits for young children.  The author not only contributed a developmentally appropriate workout of games and exercises for children, but also put forward his theory about the ways child care centers can integrate physical activity into their children's day with improved health outcomes and at extremely low financial cost.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2a559f7b9b6f0c17d49456102cc3ab7b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Community Health</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f50cf9caefcc97c0a9156cfb7ba1c70d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Golden Rice: Evaluating 'Nutritionism' and GM Food as Health Interventions in the Developing World</unittitle><unitid>UA005.031.010.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lumish, Heidi S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_828a115670506bfc12d4215d8bf34e08">Recent studies have looked at the potential for using genetic engineering as a means of introducing nutrients into staple foods, to address food insecurity in the developing world.  Through the use of genetic engineering, an existing food can be altered to enhance its nutrient content or to introduce a nutrient that is not found in wild-type varieties of the organism.  Golden rice is one such example of a genetically altered crop.  The rice has been genetically engineered to contain β-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A.  The theory behind golden rice was that it could replace traditional white rice in vitamin A deficient areas where rice is a staple crop.  In this paper, I will explore the history behind golden rice and the ensuing debate about its efficacy and rationale.  I will analyze golden rice through the lens of the 'magic bullet' philosophy to evaluate the limitations of such an approach.  I will argue that there is no ideal, all-encompassing remedy for food insecurity in the developing world.  Rather, the food insecurity that plagues developing nations demands an integrated approach, one that can start but not end with genetically enhanced crops and a search for these proclaimed 'magic bullets.'  Ultimately, the problems of food insecurity and poor health will persist unless the underlying issues of poverty and diet are addressed.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6a93563de8382346ebab049ace2a4228"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Community Health</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_60cefba4ac5d56b948f469757bd46c1f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Food Labels and Calorie Posting Laws: Their Use, Limitations, and Effectiveness as Tools in Addressing the Obesity Epidemic</unittitle><unitid>UA005.031.011.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kowitt, Sarah Dorothy</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1aafd11988b481dea302106be07f2880">Heralded as an effective public health intervention for curbing rising obesity rates, food labels and calorie posting laws are often cited as tools that can facilitate healthier personal eating behaviors. This thesis aims to evaluate this proposition through rigorous examination of the existing evidence. Overall, the research indicates that food labeling in grocery stores and restaurants is effective, but for only specific segments of the population including those of higher socioeconomic status, women, Caucasians, and those already familiar with health/weight matters. For most, there exists a multitude of other behavioral, attitudinal, situational, and product-involvement factors influencing food purchasing behavior. While alternative food label systems and the simplification and modernization of current food label regulations can facilitate modest results in healthful eating, effective solutions will encompass interventions that rely upon comprehension of other food purchasing determinants.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b006051c6904961c78301d0b1ef1cc7b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Food--Labeling</subject><subject source="local">Obesity--Prevention</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b55be1b8f6da1f1df36f31038c2f644c" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Barriers and Facilitators to Food Resources for Immigrants in Somerville, Massachusetts</unittitle><unitid>UA005.031.012.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pettoruto, Kayley A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_57cab7240be5b29113879808cabf3022">The history of food resources in the United States plays an important role in the development of the present-day infrastructure of the Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC) as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and how immigrants are affected as a result. The literature reveals that immigrants face a wide variety of barriers with obtaining food resources and some of this is directly related to the historical stigma and policy changes that have occurred over the years. Somerville is a city that is very diverse and also has a history of racism, which also affects food resource access. This project investigates the barriers and facilitators to food resources for immigrants in Somerville, Massachusetts. Data collection included six key informants of who work with immigrants in Somerville on food and health issues.

This transformation reflects the medicalization of birth. Medicalization is a phenomenon in which common or natural life events are problematized, labeled, and treated as an illness or disease. This thesis aims to answer these questions: How has this model of medicalized birth become so dominant in America? What are the effects of this medicalization? Is birth now safer under this new model of care? To answer these questions, I found resources at the Melrose Public Library and Tufts University_�_s Tisch Library, including its online catalog; I found relevant statistics on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention_�_s and World Health Organization_�_s websites. I also interviewed 20 Tufts women regarding their perceptions and expectations surrounding birth. I recruited my participants through convenience and snowball sampling. After reviewing the literature and conducting the interviews, I found that the medicalized birth model has become so dominant in America that it affects the way my participants perceive the birth process. Though it is the prevailing birth model in America, the medicalization of birth has not provided women or their infants with better care. In fact, care has probably gotten worse.

Supplementary feeding programs that distribute food to families of malnourished children have been shown to be effective in treating malnutrition. However, the feeding practices of the Beneficiary Mothers/Caretakers (BMCs) of the malnourished children often do not align with program recommendations, which may reduce programmatic impact. This study investigated a behavior change intervention designed to improve BMC compliance with feeding recommendations in the Title II Supplementary Feeding Program in Malawi. BMCs from two geographically separate areas were randomly sampled to form a group that received the educational intervention plus supplementary food and a usual care group that received only supplementary food. Eight behaviors were assessed in the areas of food preparation, food consumption, and hygiene practices. Data from an
                interviewer-administered, post-intervention questionnaire were analyzed from BMCs in the intervention group (n = 239) and usual care group (n = 163.) The intervention group showed significantly higher (p &lt; .01) rates of compliance for all three food preparation behaviors and two of three consumption behaviors in the intervention group compared to the usual care group. However, neither of the two hygiene behaviors had different rates of compliance among the groups. These results indicate that behavior change interventions can enhance the effectiveness of supplementary feeding programs, but more of an emphasis on hygiene behaviors may be needed for maximum impact.</scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Many face high burdens of parasitic disease due to their country of origin and exposures during migration. Among resettled refugees, the parasitic diseases strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis account for substantial disability and complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued comprehensive guidelines for post-arrival presumptive treatment (PT) of schistosomiasis and strongyloidiasis. Nonetheless, large numbers of refugees remain undiagnosed or untreated in the US, and studies have revealed large gaps between CDC guidelines and clinical practice. Although PT is a cost-effective and safe option for addressing parasitic diseases, refugees may undergo complicated, invasive, and expensive diagnostic tests in the US. It is essential to understand the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of clinicians and future clinicians with respect to
                strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, and PT to improve health outcomes. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 6 clinicians in Massachusetts and KAP surveys were administered to 50 students from a Boston-area medical school. Interview data suggest that negative attitudes are not responsible for low rates of PT use, but rather, that clinicians lack sufficient knowledge about and comfort with PT. The medical student surveys indicated that knowledge of parasitic disease concepts and PT is quite low among students, and that knowledge is a better indicator of one's likelihood to presumptively treat than attitudes. Integrating PT into medical school curricula and increasing clinicians' access to resources about PT may help alleviate the demonstrated knowledge gap.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

This idea is generalized to get a partial ordering of cyclic permutations called the forcing relation by taking into consideration the pattern of the periodic orbit. We show that forcing can be reduced to the study of certain canonical piecewise linear maps. Combinatorial algorithms of Baldwin and Coven et. al. that decide forcing are presented, as well as a diagram of the forcing relation on over 190 cycles of length up to 8. The global structure of forcing is described by considering flips of cycles and unimodal cycles. It is shown that the forcing relation restricted to unimodal cycles is a total ordering, and this relation is diagrammed on 115 unimodal cycles. The local structure of forcing is also explored by studying doublings and extensions. A new combinatorial proof of a theorem describing the structure of doublings in the forcing order is given. Forcing-minimal properties are examined by considering primary and simple cycles. Finally, using the results proven about the forcing relation, we derive Sharkovsky's theorem as a consequence of the forcing theorem.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_353bee1b175b395f7e6dea46dd6bfe77"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Mathematics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e539c9165e9e270d99ed49805a42c495" level="item"><did><unittitle>Block-Structured Algorithms for Domain-Wall Fermions</unittitle><unitid>UA005.032.004.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Perlmutter, Michael A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_71471b381b3e7ec13eb2f9a745d8ffd9">I researched computational techniques for inverting the domain wall operator, an important matrix arising in quantum chromodynamics.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b065e6dbb205a8a0eef49223b35d98b9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Mathematics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6d8f5e76b6ba376975c9becfa3dcb80e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Collective Relaxation Techniques for Finite-Element Discretizations of Systems of PDEs</unittitle><unitid>UA005.032.005.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Benson, Thomas R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cc559189decec8939c9ac6ceab744ee1">When attempting to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), we often look to discrete numerical methods. These methods often lead to the need to efficiently solve a large linear system. To do this, we chose to use a multigrid solver. An important part of multigrid is the relaxation of oscillatory errors in the approximation of the solution. There are cases in which traditional smoothers such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel methods either perform exceedingly poorly or completely fail altogether.

It is a difference equation that specifies the state of the fluid after a time step of fixed length, and may be considered a discrete-time equation since the time step is fixed. The discrete-time LBE (DTLBE) has a flaw in that the state of the fluid is not known during the fixed-length time step. In this paper, we present the DTLBE, derive a continuous-time LBE (CTLBE) from the DTLBE, and present a theoretical and numerical analysis of the CTLBE. Although the CTLBE is computationally more intensive than the DTLBE - it takes more floating-point operations to evolve the fluid using the CTLBE than when using the DTLBE - we find that the CTLBE is more accurate with respect to the Incompressible-Navier Stokes Equations in simulating fluid flow. Furthermore, the CTLBE allows for variable and adaptive time stepping, thus enhancing the flexibility of Lattice Boltzmann Methods for simulating fluid flow.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_972ff92ec50cbb2b5a80509d6f0d5819"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Mathematics</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_229271df1dcf5760783f4716498829a1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Reconstruction Algorithms for Bistatic Radar and Ultrasound Imaging</unittitle><unitid>UA005.032.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Levinson, Howard W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_597f4363c313ae4ce98915b567054fdf">This research examines two different models of reconstruction technologies, one based on radar and the other on ultrasound.

The beginning f an inversion algorithm exists for the circular ultrasound model, but no such algorithm has been developed yet for the linear radar model.  Furthermore, limited data problems (which we will be considering) are without inversion algorithms as well.  Therefore, in this research we will be attempting to use an easily implemented algorithm to reconstruct functions.  It turns out that this simple algorithm does indeed show most of the singularities of a function, and an ensuing discussion of microlocal analysis will provide mathematical reasonings for why this simple algorithm is able to reconstruct functions for bistatic imaging.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_281ce6ca05df100df6b6061c277e86be"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_65385a5966158513c130c4a76bf5c8ce" level="item"><did><unittitle>Improved Iterative Methods for NAPL Transport Through Porous Media</unittitle><unitid>UA005.032.008.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Minden, Victor Lawrence</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_39a4f9a0d4f7198111f141278382fc26">We consider computational algorithms for modeling the flow of certain types of groundwater contaminants through the aquifer.

After explaining the mathematical problem, we delve into a study of the Radon transform and its relation to the Fourier transform. Along with microlocal analysis, this theory allows us to make precise the relationship between the smoothness of  a function and the behavior of its localized Fourier transform, and it also predicts which singularites of a function will be reconstructed using standard reconstruction methods, even in the limited angle case. We illustrate these ideas with reconstructions of simple shapes, and we explore the effect of modifying the numerical techniques involved in implementation.

Two such models are the abstract tile assembly model, in which all tiles attach to one main assembly containing a _��seed tile,_�� and the two-handed assembly model, in which there is no seed tile and tiles can attach at any time.  This thesis presents results showing that the seed-based assembly process of any tile set that assembles under the conditions of the abstract tile assembly model can be simulated by the assembly process of another tile set in the two-handed model.  The simulation is only a constant scale factor larger than the original system and actually requires a lower temperature, a characteristic that describes how easily tiles attach to each other. This result is surprising and interesting, and provides insight into the relative fundamental computational power of both models. This work has direct applications in DNA computing, where biologists are using these models to self-assemble pieces of DNA (represented abstractly by tiles) into structures at the nanoscale level.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fa2f6637c3f3962b9d1c653e05618d54"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_7d8eab3a70071a6479bb1f12ce0145c3" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Study of Normality by Cayley Graphs and Their Quotients</unittitle><unitid>UA005.032.011.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ivy, Devin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_839d804f3dbe06d360e906eb79e7bb71">Here we study the group-theoretic concept of normality by characterizing normal subgroups as they appear within a parent group's Cayley graph.

In idealized models, there is a sharp boundary between a parameter regime where the I-cells have weak enough drive for PING, and one where they have so much drive that they fire without being prompted by the E-cells. In the latter regime, they often de-synchronize and suppress the E-cells; the boundary was therefore called the suppression boundary by B̦rgers and Kopell (2005). The model I-cells used in the earlier work by B̦rgers and Kopell have a type 1 phase response, i.e., excitatory input always advances them. However, fast-spiking inhibitory basket cells often have a type 2 phase response: excitatory input arriving soon after they fire delays them. We study the effect of the phase response type on the suppression transition, under the additional assumption that the I-cells are kept synchronous by gap junctions. When many E-cells participate on a given cycle, the resulting excitation advances the I-cells on the next cycle if their phase response is of type 1, and this can result in suppression of more E-cells on the next cycle. Therefore strong E-cell spike volleys tend to be followed by weaker ones, and vice versa. This often results in erratic fluctuations in the strengths of the E-cell spike volleys. When the phase response of the I-cells is of type 2, the opposite happens: strong E-cell spike volleys delay the inhibition on the next cycle, therefore tend to be followed by yet stronger ones. The strengths of the E-cell spike volleys don't oscillate, and there is a nearly abrupt transition from PING to ING (a rhythm involving I-cells only).</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5ac18724c6818ca931fa818e92ab2257"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Mathematics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2133ba06a220af3715e4a09858130e23" level="item"><did><unittitle>Time-Step Constraints for Reaction-Diffusion Problems</unittitle><unitid>UA005.032.013.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fortunato, Daniel F.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ce4187e82c72711eeb70f80135e69254">Reaction-diffusion equations naturally arise in many biological, physical, chemical, and ecological contexts. Fisher's equation is the simplest reaction-diffusion equation. It models a population growing logistically while diffusing in space and admits traveling wave solutions. We consider finite difference schemes for Fisher's equation, which depend on the size of the time step used. We can discretize Fisher's equation using explicit methods (like forward Euler or midpoint) or implicit methods (like backward Euler or Crank-Nicolson). For the explicit methods, a time step constraint appears as the result of a CFL condition. For backward Euler, there is no time step constraint. However, to solve the nonlinear system of equations with Newton's method or fixed-point iteration, the constraint reappears as a convergence constraint. If instead we use multigrid to solve the nonlinear system of equations, the constraint comes back as a convergence constraint for both the correction scheme (CS) and the full approximation scheme (FAS). If in the relaxation scheme for FAS we solve the nonlinear equations exactly---which the simplicity of Fisher's equation allows us to do---then the constraint appears once again as an accuracy constraint. Crank-Nicolson is unconditionally stable and second-order in time, so discretizing Fisher's equation using Crank-Nicolson and then using FAS to solve the system of equations relaxes the accuracy constraint somewhat.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d7ac45f20ff0dd54469f8d179b8695b5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Mathematics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a078211fbf981f0f4cd2f9982858c276" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Structure of Orthogonal and Symplectic Geometries</unittitle><unitid>UA005.032.014.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chowdhury, Samir</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7e8447d9bce1f443f8921aa11152922c">This undergraduate thesis examines orthogonal and symplectic geometries, and how they are connected to the study of orthogonal and symplectic groups.

Why does this not lead to a chain reaction, with faster firing generating yet faster firing, and so fourth -- or does it, sometimes? We study this question first for a single integrate-and-fire neuron with synaptic self-excitation and self-inhibition, in essence modelling recurrent synaptic connections in a network. Even for this simple model, we supplement analytic results with numerical ones. We then study the same question, using numerical simulations, for a single Hodgkin-Huxley-like model neuron with synaptic self-excitation and self-inhibition, and finally for a network of Hodgkin-Huxley-like excitatory and inhibitory model neurons.  We found that in cases when there would be runaway activity with purely self-excitatory, non-saturating synaptic currents in both the integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley-like models, adding inhibition tends to create bi-stability, i.e. a situation in which stable rhythmic firing can be ``shocked'' into runaway activity by a strong external drive.  This bi-stability was also reproduced in a neuronal network of excitatory and inhibitory model neurons.  In neuronal networks, in which excitatory synapses were modelled by saturating synaptic currents, this transition appeared to be dependent on the species of excitatory chemical synapse, as well as the strength of those synapses.  From these findings, we may gain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind runaway activity in a single neuron, as well as runaway circuit activity in a neuronal network.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_59632c710f4ae90880732265e52bd729"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Mathematics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a5302fe94174985967c09356a5abb7ba" level="item"><did><unittitle>Multilinear Subspace Clustering</unittitle><unitid>UA005.032.016.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kernfeld, Eric M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_53d7c2dc4aab3e5b80bd2e6abb9a089a">This thesis is on a topic from the mathematics of machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. In sections 1 to 4, we consider extensions of the subspace clustering problem, which has lately inspired algorithmic developments applicable to computer vision, genomics, music analysis, and electroencephalography. This problem is simple to state: given multivariate data grouped along many low-dimensional subspaces, find the subspaces and the points"
                                memberships. Although some applications of subspace clustering algorithms involve data with matrix structure, recent algorithms disregard that, vectorizing data as part of the processing. We modify the subspace clustering problem using a construct from multilinear algebra, the tensor product of subspaces. This allows us to derive new algorithms that do not alter the original form of the data. We will argue that the new algorithms can carry out analysis more
                                quickly and accurately than we could through subspace clustering. We mention applications where it may be possible to exploit this performance improvement. Our algorithms convert the multilinear subspace clustering problem into a graph clustering problem, where every point in a subspace is represented by a node on the graph and points are (ideally) connected if they belong to the same subspace. The algorithm we present to solve the modified subspace clustering
                                problem is a randomized algorithm, and multiple trials are needed. Since every trial produces a new realization of the graph, we use sections 4 through 8 to consider various ways of combining graph realizations. We conduct tests on simulated data in order to evaluate them.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_06c154825d8a70ed1635d64f55e59e49"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

In this work, we focused on one particular AEM, the Yard-Sale Model (YSM), in which transactions are pairwise between agents and exchanges are always fractions of the poorer agent's wealth. In recent work, Boghosian derived a Boltzmann equation for the YSM and showed that with a kinetic approach to wealth distributions, the YSM exhibits qualitative agreement with Pareto's Law and may indeed be the first explanation of this macroeconomic observation since it was first proposed nearly a century ago. One of the shortcomings of the YSM is its symmetric trading assumption wherein both agents in a transaction have an equal likelihood of winning. In this work, we reconsidered the YSM in the presence of a trading bias based on the idea that economic agents may have an advantage or disadvantage due to their intrinsic characteristics such as race,
                gender, etc. We assigned agents within the YSM to have a single valued parameter representing their trading advantage and we derived a pair of coupled Boltzmann equations and the resulting Fokker-Planck equations. We considered the effects of this Bias due to Agent Attributes (BAA) on the kinetics of wealth and the implications this may have on the dynamics of inequality and the relationships between redistribution and trade.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

With the abrupt transition to dictatorship on September 11, 1973 came corresponding cultural transformations.  Along with the wider cultural changes that took place after 1973, Chile's literary scene was drastically altered due to the policy of censorship, the military intervention of universities, the realities of political exile and imprisonment and the dismantling of the state-run publishing house. Paradoxically, despite the many impediments to writing and publishing, Chilean writers of the generation of the eighties attest to the fact that there had never been more literary production.  The Collective of Young Writers (Colectivo de Escritores J&amp;#x00f3;venes), which united writers who were beginning their literary careers under emergency political conditions, is one example of the type of cultural movement that flourished under the dictatorship.  Drawing from a series of interviews with former members of the collective, I present the group's history and examine its relationship to cultural and social movements that unfolded post-1973.  I argue that the unique political context of the 1980s stimulated literary production by providing writers with a clear theme and making cultural activity an alternative means of doing politics.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fc88a1091fce644b65ec01998dbe855b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of International Letters and Visual Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d9bd5abb8490e147dd94a3c4f6fd5ba0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Diary of an Illegal Immigrant: Memoirs from Spain and Morocco</unittitle><unitid>UA005.033.006.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cannon, Elinor B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f197b8a5955da535c563183ed4e10e8d">Immigration in the Europe and North America has become one of the most pressing issues of this century, and the world's civilizations grow closer and closer together every day. In Europe, already a hub for cultural exchange and overlap, people of all social classes and educational backgrounds from North Africa and the Middle East are leaving their countries and transplanting themselves all over the continent. In 1999, Moroccan journalist Rashid Nini published Diario de un illegal (Arabic: Yawm y t muh jir sirr), a compilation of his memoirs and accounts of his time living and working in Spain illegally. The author is an educated, university-graduate Moroccan who arrives to Spain as a "journalist correspondent," but is forced to spend most of his time working in orange fields and cafes. Each chapter is written in the present tense, universalizing each of his experiences and reflecting the thoughts and feelings of all illegal immigrants. Originally written in Arabic, the book has since been translated into Spanish and published in Spain. I have worked to produce an English translation of the book, drawing from both the Arabic and Spanish versions, and used it as a basis for observations on comparative and collaborative translating. Finally, I reflect on the writer's experiences and how they represent the bloc of North African immigrants in Spain as a whole.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_625bb18d54a0beb50c3f9c23878aa833"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Immigrants</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4d04511d6b714772914e2e24cd87ff54" level="item"><did><unittitle>Infinite Correspondence</unittitle><unitid>UA005.033.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pyenson, Lucas</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ff232b870dc59ea578e44d3454b98dac">A brief history of French and Arab cookbooks, as well as French influence on North African cuisine, and North African influence on French cuisine.

In tracing this evolution, I hope to demonstrate how Japanese authors have both cited and reinterpreted the ideas of the original French surrealists in their works. This will entail a historical overview of both the French and Japanese surrealist movements, a critical analysis of their cultural exchange, and finally a thematic reading of two modern Japanese texts_��Yasanari Kawabata_�_s short story _��House of the Sleeping Beauties_�� and Haruki Murakami_�_s novel Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World_��in relation to the poetics of French surrealism. The Japanese encounter with French literary surrealism provides a particularly fascinating and difficult example of how a system of thought and aesthetic practice can move and change over time, as well as across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

I have encountered many modern designs from Japan and Denmark that bear the quality of being so ordinary that they become extraordinary.
\

\
Often times, this appreciation for the ordinary is expressed through the designer_�_s appreciation for simplicity, his or her refusal to change anything if it already works, and by focusing on the smaller, overlooked details.  Through an abundant use of wood and other natural materials, we can also see the designer_�_s value for nature.  And by creating functional solutions that are attentive to the convenience of the user, they exhibit the aim to provide as much human interaction and comfort as possible.
\

\
Many modern designs described as minimal or functional are cold, stark, and uninviting.  The Japanese and Danish designers that I have selected to analyze in my thesis produce things that are both minimal and functional, but by returning to basics, these designers create things that are warm, whole, inviting, and timeless.  In order to move away from the consumer-driven goal that has become so linked with the design realm, this return to basics might be an important step.

An English-language movie adaptation (1984) was released several years later. The author himself took part in the early stages of production. Though initially enthusiastic about the project, he ultimately revoked all forms of affiliation to the movie. Where did it all go wrong?To address this question in full, this paper draws on three fields of academic inquiry: (1) Narrative Theory  It is difficult to define The Neverending Story in terms of genre. A story about stories in itself, The Neverending Story may be considered an amalgamation of various types of narrative. At the same time, it serves as a commentary on narratives in general. This section provides an overview of the book's narrative genealogy. (2) Reader-Response Theory  The book aims to engage the reader in an imaginative and playful manner. This section draws on Wolfgang Iser's notion of the text as a playing field for the author and reader, to consider how the reader may interact with a text to construct images and establish some sense of meaning. (3) Adaptation Theory  In this section, I trace some of the key issues encountered in adapting the book to the screen. The fundamental question is what constitutes a story's kerneland I question whether such a thing exists at all. Moving beyond the issue of fidelity, I encourage thinking of narrative in terms of ideology.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2d83a921d84f36cff0912cc50e1d2241"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of International Letters and Visual Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3b9d7c23fdff730c55833a29e9ef3bed" level="item"><did><unittitle>Mexican Murals and Fascist Frescoes: Cultural Reinvention in 20th-Century Mexico and Italy</unittitle><unitid>UA005.033.012.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sussman, Maya Dallin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_709c104f7f360897f164145b12a068b7">In the 1920s aftermath of the Mexican Revolution, politicians, intellectuals, and artists built on Mexico's culture and history to unify citizens across regional and class boundaries. Throughout the 1930s, the Italian Fascist government also relied on history and tradition as a means for establishing a unifying national identity. Through visual and textual analysis, I examine the role of muralism as a medium through which artists contributed to the reinvention of cultural identity in a time of political uncertainty and change. My research examines the ways in which early-twentieth-century Mexican and Italian muralists looked to Renaissance techniques and styles for inspiration, in an attempt to redefine their countries' history, international image, and national identity. In the Mexican context, I analyze the influence of the Italian Renaissance art that Diego Rivera viewed and sketched while traveling in Italy on the murals he later created in Mexico. My Italian research focuses on the ways in which Achille Funi drew on Renaissance frescoes and epic poems when creating his murals for the Palazzo Comunale in Ferrara. Despite the distinct cultural and political environments in which they worked, both Rivera and Funi created monumental and persuasive works of art by combining Renaissance techniques and styles with modern ideological and cultural concerns.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7d4845504888cd49803d54778653478b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of International Letters and Visual Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bfbbe6ca69c30be7d443a8aa0dc06c2d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Les femmes algériennes s'expriment: L'évocation des arts expessifs chez Assia Djebar et Leïla Sebbar</unittitle><unitid>UA005.033.013.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Quackenbush, Katherine A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_077698504f6b9e7462a74a5b5f388413">Dans cet essai nous traiterons les uvres de deux auteures contemporaines d'origines alg̩riennes qui ̩crivent pour faire parler les femmes alg̩riennes au sujet de leurs propres exp̩riences et de leurs propres identit̩s.

And, indeed, this idea has colored much of the criticism concerning Abe's work. Criticism of Abe has given little attention to Abe's aesthetic creations and focuses more on the language and interaction of Abe's characters. This focus on Abe's language has often led critics to paint Abe in a heavily modernist light, identifying him more often with Western modernist and absurdist writers like Franz Kafka more than with his Japanese contemporaries like Kenzaburō Ōe.    While it is tempting to relegate many of Abe's images as modernistic constructs of the absurd, painted as hypercritically bizarre in order to shock his readers, this reading diminishes their status as internal to Abe's personal experience. Many of Abe's images are derived from his own dreams and experiences , intrinsically linking the failure of his protagonists to parse their lives' meaning with his own struggle with the failure of logical systems. Abe's leading men are isolated in a world composed of nothing objects, constructs of societal convenience which serve only as a thin veil over the unreliable absurdity of the individual experience. What this amounts to, is the view that Abe's vision of the world was materialistically informed, relying on the phenomenological experience of the body and the objects of its environment rather than a belief in a consistent or pervasive essence. This thesis will focus primarily on the works: The Ark Sakura (Hakobune Sakura Maru, 1984) and Kangaroo Notebook (Kangaroo Nto, 1991), the two final completed novels of Abe's career. Both The of these novels have received little critical attention in comparison to Abe's early works, due in part to their lack of comparable popularity, but also because of the complexity of the plot and structure of the novels, which focus less on the exposition of characters and more on the visually-oriented aspects of the plot than his previous pieces. In this analysis, I work to elucidate the importance of Abe's fascination with these images in his later works as a signal of a powerful postmodern sentiment vital to the development of these pieces. To this end, this thesis examines these images in the context of two central thematic elements of Abe's pieces which gained greater significance in his later work: humor and vanity. Appended to this analysis is a translation of one of Abe's collections of short stories and essays, Laughing Moon (Warau Tsuki, 1975), which provides unique insight into Abe's creative process as well as his development of images used in a number of his creative pieces, taken from his dreams and personal experience. It is the aim of this project to expand on the understanding of Abe Kb's later works and to attempt to offer new alternatives in considering the importance of imagery to his work, an aspect of his novels that has been widely ignored in established criticisms preceding this one.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_345b564ccdd2a1d86fb963d7f75f8c99"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of International Letters and Visual Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5c9aaa58cb99fe07570e0c1f1bb3fe5e" level="item"><did><unittitle>(En)gendering New Roles: War and Exile as Agents of Female Empowerment in Contemporary Iraqi Women's Literature</unittitle><unitid>UA005.033.015.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Minoff, Natalya</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9ed81aac861952a5855489249f65f090">In my thesis, I will conduct a comparative analysis of the wartime and exilic narratives written by three contemporary female Iraqi authors. Through a close reading of Betool Khedairi's two novels Absent (2004) and A Sky So Close (2001), Mikhail's poetical memoir Diary of a Wave Outside the Sea (2009), and al-Radi's autobiographical journal Baghdad Diaries (1998), I will assess the extent to which the experiences of war and exile elicit a renegotiation of gender&#13;
                                roles for the female protagonists in their works. For the Iraqi women who they portray in their texts, both the 1990-91 Gulf War and the subsequent period of exile bring about certain voids, which serve as windows of opportunity for them to subvert conventional gendered hierarchies and assert themselves through various modes of creative expression. In the absence of their husbands during the war, these female characters take on new roles and responsibilities&#13;
                                within their households that empower them. Likewise, the departure from their native countries and traditions while living in exile allows them increased freedom of expression and mobility. Hence, both war and exile dismantle traditional relationships and power dynamics, enabling the female characters in these works to renegotiate their identities. Furthermore, through the very act of writing, Khedairi, Mikhail, and al-Radi exert their authority as Iraqi women&#13;
                                during the Gulf War and in exile thereafter. The publication of their texts revolutionized Iraq's literary tradition, transforming it to include the female narrative. Thus, these female authors exemplify the very societal reconstruction that they illustrate through the content of their works, using their writing to reconfigure the cultural fabric of Iraqi society.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3eda07ff4950e702540f6c71e8684c98"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Handel's work Semele should be labeled is the larger question of why it exists at all and what it means. Handel had been struggling in the years leading up to the creation of Semele. Professional failures led to personal attacks; poor health and changing political as well as societal tastes combined to present Handel with real challenges. After a journey to Dublin where the debut of his most popular work, Messiah, occurred, Handel returned with a new sense of vigor, and Semele was created, much to the chagrin of several of his adversaries. The response was immediately poor, but the importance of the title character of Semele and her fatal flaws cannot be overemphasized. This thesis further examines the concept and ideas behind Handel's Semele. From Handel's style in both opera and oratorio to how the oratorio came into being, Handel's path to creating the hybrid Semele is traced. Discussion of the work's proper classification and historical reaction then appears. The research next delves into the origins and sources for the story as well as the plot of the libretto. Semele as a social and political commentary is explored through an investigation of contemporary newspapers found in the Charles Burney collection in the British Library. This is followed by an in-depth look at how the character of Semele is represented through Handel's music. Finally, discussion of the performance history and modern recordings round out the thesis.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ef28d1f694151587314275d822306f76"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Department of Music</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bda44ddad838f68158a8581e6fa8fddb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Belting Beauties and Soaring Sopranos: Vocal Pedagogy to Address the Wide-Ranging Needs of Musical Theatre Females</unittitle><unitid>UA005.034.005.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Trudeau, Jared L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_665ac97d6ec1af68d6e1f5b4c2838a7a">American musical theatre is an art form whose origins lie in the light-operetta of the late 19th century.  Since then the influences of blues, jazz, ragtime, torch singing, crooning, Romantic period opera, rock, country, pop, R&amp;B, gospel, and folk have been mixed together to create a truly eclectic dramatic art form.  The vocal demands placed on actresses today include singing classically-influenced coloratura soprano lines in one show to belting a pop-rock score the next.  Only in the past two decades has legitimate discussion of musical theatre vocal pedagogy been a topic of serious academic investigation, and it is still limited in scope and application.  Classical vocal pedagogy has been developed and explored since the first voice manual was published in 1723.  Most teachers of singing are well aware of the basic tenants of classical pedagogy: breath management, legato line, open pharyngeal space, low larynx, and chiaroscuro timbre, to name a few. While many of these fundamentals are useful to singers of many genres, classical pedagogy as it is practiced fails to prepare singers for all of the demands of musical theatre.  The contemporary roles of Clara (The Light in the Piazza), Glinda (Wicked), and Natalie (Next to Normal) present the technical requirements of female ingenues ranging from legit singing to contemporary belting. In this thesis, issues of breath management, body alignment, registration, acoustics, and resonance are addressed through these specific roles, blending classical and contemporary vocal pedagogy.  Proper training promotes health vocal function and a sustainable technique that meets the diverse needs of musical theatre actresses.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_eedc68db9fefae010abbd4d288acd4cd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Musical theater--Instruction and study</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7ef7601fbd0809e44630e0a46c9043ab" level="item"><did><unittitle>Hugo Wolf and the Nineteenth-Century Lied: The Development of Lieder as Reflection of Changing Ideologies, Music Aesthetics and Compositional Development</unittitle><unitid>UA005.034.006.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">King, Jordan A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3abd1ad19cd9c32943b6059f74885966">Viennese composer Hugo Wolf (1860-1903) wrote hundreds of songs, setting pre-existing German poems to music. By the late nineteenth century, this genre, known as the Lied, had a sizable pre-existing repertoire. Wolf avoided setting poetry that had been set by other composers unless he felt that the poetry had been misinterpreted. Wolf_�_s contemporaries also had a strong, well-developed view on the artistic value of the Lied relative to the wider classical music tradition; because song traditionally toed the line between popular and serious music, and was a small form, the genre was held in low esteem when compared to large-scale instrumental works. As a former music critic, Wolf was very much aware of this hierarchy, and was admittedly self-conscious about his perceived artistic worth.
\
The songs he chose to re-set had been set by composers that were also well known for their symphonic works, including Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, and Johannes Brahms. Wolf rarely composed in these large forms, and his reputation rests solely on his songs; therefore, I propose that his re-setting of poetry is a means of challenging these other composers on his own terms, in order to establish himself in the classical music tradition. In my thesis, I explore the cultural politics of the late nineteenth century as they relate to classical music, and perform comparative analyses of selected songs set by Wolf and others to explore the means in which he uses composition as criticism, giving new meaning to the Lied in the process.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1fc741344218d22917db2a37a872d047"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_3e0e4e34c2f98c3e80ee50b959c84208" level="item"><did><unittitle>Humans making Sound</unittitle><unitid>UA005.034.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Joseph, Daniel P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0ca622a8e0b4d90110f0324b09ef62e8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_d376e426f77ca6df9a1882833effa5f2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper outlines a two and a half year progression during which I have been exploring one fundamental question from different angles: how can I bring music making to the non-musician? Put another way, the question might read, 'how can I create structured situations in which people feel comfortable to participate in music making?' The paper draws on scholarly works in ethnomusicology, sound studies, and music composition to outline how I came to ask this question, why I believe it to be of importance, and to describe various ways I've tried to encourage communal music making, including the creation of a public space for 'pick-up music', in the same way that one thinks of pick-up sports. I advocate a view of musical ability akin to linguistic ability. Rather than a lack of musical ability, I believe social inhibitions and norms about a smaller class of people being musicians and a majority being 'non-musicians', or 'not musical', are the fundamental reasons
                why so many people are not able to actively participate in music making. I work to increase access to such opportunities - to bring music making to the non-musician.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

On December 21, 1879, the Royal Theater in Copenhagen premiered the play Et dukkehjem (A Doll's House), by Henrik Ibsen. Little did the theater know that the final door slam of Ibsen's work would create shockwaves throughout public audiences not only in Europe, but across the globe. A Doll's House focuses on the Helmers, a seemingly typical family for late 19th-century Europe, and this archetypal structure allows Ibsen to highlight gender issues in a realistic setting. The mother of the household, Nora, battles through a plot filled with secrecy, manipulation, and constant societal constraint. At last, Nora discovers that she must fully break out of the world she has been held to her entire life in order to truly become an individual: she must find her own music. What is then striking about A Doll's House to me, as a composer, is the idea of music becoming the bird's gilded cage of Nora trapped in the strict, structural
                confines of a musical format. This led me to write a 90-minute opera in three short acts based on A Doll's House, which uses the structure of an opera as a symbol of Nora's confines, as well as, ultimately, her freedom. The piece was performed in full on May 1st, 2015, stage directed by Allison Benko and in collaboration with Bare Bodkin Theatre Company and the Tufts Opera Ensemble.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

However, every year approximately five thousand patients are diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and undergo a total laryngectomy resulting in the removal of their entire larynx. Without the larynx, these patients are unable to produce speech through conventional means and many use an artificial larynx, also called an electrolarynx (EL), to  ommunicate. ELs are battery operated handheld devices which transmit a pulse train the user's neck where the sound may be modulated into speech. They are commonly selected as a method of voice restoration due to their portability and ease of use. However, EL devices have many qualities which result in the speech being unnatural and unintelligible. Two of the qualities which contribute most to the unnatural and unintelligible nature of EL speech are the lack of accurate frequency variation and the irradiated noise from the device. Of the devices currently available, most provide little or no opportunity to vary pitch or provide a method of pitch variation which does not allow for pitch contours similar to those found in normal speech. Additionally, due to the nature of their construction, irradiated noise is found in all EL devices. This research focuses on a method of improving the control of the fundamental frequency of the device and methods of reducing the irradiated noise from the device.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a41972bfd916cd42cd58e577914c454c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e1e188292d9352b7e37dcc203c2b10b5" level="item"><did><unittitle>The nature of resonant coupling between microstrip resonators</unittitle><unitid>UA005.035.008.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ahsan, Atiyah Sayyidah</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6151409b19a3cc0ad72387c5740f6a3f">Microstrip resonators create plasma at room temperature and atmospheric pressure when powered by low power microwave sources.

By ana- lyzing the texture of an image, it is possible to generate data about the subpixel structure of the image's subject. Specifically, in the problem of diagnosing the severity of osteoarthritis (OA) in the periartricular tibia (i.e., bone just under the knee joint), texture analysis can be used to quantify changes in the trabecular structure of the bone even when the trabeculae are not resolved in the MRI image. Texture-based techniques provide medical researchers a tool for understanding OA and how it changes over time. To explore the utility of texture techniques, a process was developed which predicts OA severity relative to an existing benchmark, the relative perarticular Bone Mineral Density (paBMD) as determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This processed was developed and tested using a dataset consisting of knee MRI images from 50 patients.  After exploring a variety of methods, a three step process was implemented. First, image segmentation is performed in order to identify the region of interest (ROI) in the image with minimal human input, a task previously performed entirely manually. Second, spatial filters are applied to each ROI in order to generate texture maps. A bank of 40 filters was used which consisted of two classes of filters: Laws texture energy masks and Gabor filters. Statistics are taken on the texture maps (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, entropy). Third, the statistics are then used as features for a regression problem. To solve the regression problem, kernel-Support Vector Regression with a 4th degree polynomial was found to be the best performing algorithm.  In the final analysis, the knee images of 39 patients were used in a cross-validation scheme. A prediction root-mean square error of 11% was obtained, suggesting that texture analysis techniques can be used as tools for analyzing trabecular structure in MRIs.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fafd6e341f886e044244f5b55f25f972"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Imaging systems in medicine</subject><subject source="local">Osteoarthritis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_03f19350cba8f871c79e9caaa315e826" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of Strain Release via Interfacial Misfit Arrays on the Optical Properties of GaSb/GaAs Heterojunctions</unittitle><unitid>UA005.035.010.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Magden, Emir Salih</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c641b1fae46912f161842b90c34ae0e9">Integration of electrical and optical structures on a single chip is essential for mass production of low cost optoelectronics due to their smaller footprint, higher throughput efficiencies, and general ease of handling. However, this integration is extremely hard to achieve in case of heterojunctions, where the interfacing materials have different crystal properties. One method of growing reliable heterostructures involves the intentional creation of highly periodic, localized dangling bonds at the interface of the two materials to release the strain energy. Use of this method, however, can affect the optical behavior of the epitaxial layer. Since the idea of a heterojunction is to exploit the properties of one material without having to change the substrate layer, retaining or pointing out the changes to the optical properties is key to proper device operation. Specifically in case of GaSb/GaAs heterojunctions, using ellipsometry and x-ray diffraction, it has been discovered that use of this technique increases the absorption coefficient and the index of refraction of the epitaxial layer. Depending on the application, these may or may not be desirable effects. Additionally, analysis methods are generalized for future use with different samples.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_595a697abc81c3a4d124e4b541309225"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_602f1d79e611f8ed0954bec5bd7acc02" level="item"><did><unittitle>A White-Box Approach to Function-Parameter Co-Estimation for Kinetic Models of Biochemical Networks</unittitle><unitid>UA005.035.011.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hopkins, Calvin Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_af0379d678747239b763edf234b641be">Kinetic modeling attempts to describe the time-dependent behavior of every enzyme-catalyzed reaction in the network. Systems of ordinary differential equations express each reaction rate as a function of metabolite concentrations and rate constant parameters. The mechanistic knowledge of enzyme kinetics however is not always available.  Furthermore, estimating a consistent set of rate parameters from time-series data requires a large experimental effort for even a moderately-sized network. This work develops approximate kinetic expressions for a module (connected groups of reactions) instead of developing kinetic expressions for each reaction within the module.  Our modeling utilizes Convenience Kinetics to capture system dynamics.  We develop a genetic algorithm to explore the trade offs between expression accuracy and simplicity, in terms of including variables representing the concentration of metabolites internal to the module.   When eliminating an internal variable, our algorithm compensates by calculating a new set of parameter values and shifting the roles of remaining metabolites as activators and inhibitors.   Our validation efforts on three test cases demonstrate such tradeoffs, and show that modest loss of accuracy is possible when some internal metabolite concentrations are eliminated and when the resulting system is gamed to compensate for the missing variables.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3a8422030dc851f37a4b6b1237f4887e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_25b8af015893111937b2745f9d855b42" level="item"><did><unittitle>Automated Threat Detection for Disaster Response Teams Using UAV Platforms</unittitle><unitid>UA005.035.012.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Schweig, Andrew M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a01acb2dd1eb0ffd9c26d0526170935a">I present a sensor system, mountable on a commercially available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

With the techniques of Allender et al., we present an analysis of how the ability to quickly distinguish Kolmogorov randomness allows for a probabilistic attack on two of the conjectured hard problems underlying public-key cryptography: the discrete logarithm and factoring. Specifically, Kolmogorov random strings are pertinent to inverting one-way functions and distinguishing pseudorandomness from true uniform randomness. This method provides a lens that more sharply categorizes the hardness of the discrete logarithm and factoring in the hierarchy of well-known complexity classes. An overview of public-key cryptosystems is presented alongside the traditional analysis of one-way functions and pseudorandom generators. Using this approach, we establish relationships between provably secure public-key cryptography, Kolmogorov complexity, and the essential cryptographic primitives and put forth conjectures of how these relationships may extend into methods for solving other types of problems.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4526d2845f40e026083e53d68c116a55"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Computer Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c6bb86ffe62494b49290903f28c440d0" level="item"><did><unittitle>New Methods for Ontology Alignment</unittitle><unitid>UA005.036.002.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Moran, Kelly</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_238d314c8efebab9f196585270c42cc0">Aligning multiple ontologies has come to the forefront of the data integration field as a critical and complex problem without a single universally applicable solution. Many different semi-automatic and automatic solutions have been proposed, each solving a piece of the alignment problem and leading to a developing picture of how to best integrate the ever-growing information of the Semantic Web. In this work, we present a context-sensitive ontology alignment algorithm, CompositeMatch, that considers one aspect of the problem: the problem of accurately identifying composite matches. These matches, which arise when one concept is equivalent to the combination of multiple others, are an often-overlooked portion of an accurate alignment. CompositeMatch identifies these matches, along with the typical one-to-one matches, by taking advantage of the information provided by a concept's surrounding concepts, referred to as the context'' of a concept. Because the algorithm looks more broadly at concepts and the information that their relationships confer, it can identify both composite and non-composite matches. In the end, this methodology provides more accurate matches between ontologies that differ structurally. In this paper, we show that our algorithm can correctly identify composite matches more confidently than existing, high-performing alignment tools.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5a8d175c52e699746bcd48136ef2d285"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Computer Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d7a303d03569369b4227fb74a78c5784" level="item"><did><unittitle>Discovering and Searching Loosely Coupled Subproblems in Dou Shou Qi</unittitle><unitid>UA005.036.003.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Burnett, Joseph W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_76fc9834a90622aeddfadc259c015493">We present a technique for discovering, isolating and searching loosely coupled subproblems in the game of Dou Shou Qi. Subproblem discovery utilizes a minimum weight spanning tree to find clustering structure [10] in a complete graph of causality, which captures the distance between pieces in terms of a lower-bound on time-to-effect. A heuristic extends the duration of the split by isolating subproblems, effectively trimming branches of the game tree which do not conform to the clustering structure. Searching loosely coupled subproblems in Go has been explored by Berlekamp [2]. Basic Dou Shou Qi strategy is outlined and used to develop a position evaluation function for the minimax algorithm. Additionally an algorithm to update a minimum spanning tree in O(n) time per outline set of neighborhood updates is proposed, conditional upon its being rooted in some simple transform of a Euclidean or Manhattan metric, and upon a maximum edge weight change which is constantly upper-bound. The minimum spanning tree updating algorithm, which uses simple data structures, improves on the more general result of Frederickson's O(sqrt(|E|)) time per update [5] by allowing n-1 neighborhood updates to occur in O(n) time on a complete graph, effectively in constant time per update.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0f94f97c6cf9c401ffbe86d6fbf5aa18"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Computer Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ba4722054e47111a32da74fcce3091e4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Detecting Between-Pathway Model conservation across S. cerevisiae and S. pombe yeast species</unittitle><unitid>UA005.036.004.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Malmer, Daniel A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5ad51ba1a6c398e3e69b5df67335aa9e">The Between-Pathway Model (BPM) motif identifies pairs of fault-tolerant gene pathways within the yeast interactome. In BPMs, many gene pairs between the two pathways contain synthetic lethal interactions, meaning if you knock out one gene or the other only, the yeast lives, while knocking out both is lethal. This suggests that each pathway in a BPM compensates when an opposite pathway is suppressed, defective, or absent. Algorithms have been used to find suggested BPMs in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe species of yeast. Here we identify and apply a method for finding conservation of BPMs across these two species. By mapping orthologous genes between the two yeast species, we are able to identify BPM pathways which are highly conserved. Furthermore, with Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, we can infer functional conservation as well. Given the large evolutionary distance between S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, a high rate of rewiring within the interactome is generally expected. However, in certain BPMs we found a large percentage of gene conservation and GO enrichment. Some of the pathways we identified were even found in the literature to be conserved across mouse and human. With this research, we hope to identify pathways which are evolutionarily conserved across S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, and encourage continued study of Between-Pathway Models.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_044a146eb5bfd1c010d08d1734a6a4a6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Computer Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f85e40dea1a469e8707bfb56918963c0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Paths Around Obstacles</unittitle><unitid>UA005.036.005.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Al Jubeh, Marwan Ibrahim</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cabe3ea6881f946d74c558cb88d06437">Connectivity augmentation is an important area of study in optimization. For a given graph, a connectivity augmentation problem asks to augment the graph (add edges) such that the augmented graph has the desired connectivity. Motivated by the problem of making a given non-crossing geometric graph 3-vertex connected, we consider the following augmentation problem: for a non-crossing geometric graph given in the form of convex obstacles inside a triangular container, augment the graph such that each obstacle has three disjoint paths to the container's boundary. We prove a lower bound on the number of edges needed for the augmentation, and also give an augmentation algorithm, which provides an upper bound.  Furthermore, motivated by the problem where the obstacles not only must have three disjoint paths to the boundary, but where those paths are also required to be locally-geodesic. We attempt to find an algorithm that would produce three disjoint locally-geodesic paths to the vertices of a triangular container from any point in the free space that is surrounded by line-segment obstacles. We document the various attempts we made to produce such an algorithm, and present counterexamples where these approaches fail. We conclude by presenting a promising line of attack for which we have not been able to find a counterexample.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_528f19311e07f6bf4e5a2d2867db76ae"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Computer Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_78fb2f519e3b73d496cd9f2f406a5c38" level="item"><did><unittitle>On the computational complexity of equivalence relations under kernel reductions</unittitle><unitid>UA005.036.006.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Finkelstein, Jeffrey J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_df3f14cb2518be0d4211578410b6c2cd">In this paper we analyze the notion of kernel reductions among equivalence problems, as defined in Fortnow and Grochow.

We then examine the graph isomorphism problem and problems equivalent to it under polynomial time many-one reductions, and find that of these problems the ones which are equivalence problems are in fact equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem under polynomial time kernel reductions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cba665977e9aef94b4d08062bf95537e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Computer Science</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1275f750e3eceedb2f8c58390c5c2eb8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Formatt: Correcting Protein Multiple Structural Alignments by Sequence Peeking</unittitle><unitid>UA005.036.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nadimpalli, Shilpa Vidhya</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_55684e98b6cefd0c4b3cd85bd770c855">Multiple protein alignments have several computational biology applications, including detection of protein homology, identification of conserved regions, or construction of HMMs as templates for protein families. Although it has been shown that structure-based methods produce better multiple protein alignments than pure sequence aligners, structural aligners that ignore all sequence information are prone to making easily-avoidable frame offset errors. We present Formatt, a multiple protein structural alignment program that also takes sequence similarity into account when constructing alignments. Formatt is based on the Matt purely geometric multiple structural alignment program.  We show that Formatt is superior to Matt in alignment quality based on objective measures (most notably Staccato "Seq" and "Str" scores) while preserving the same advantages in core length and RMSD that Matt, as a flexible structural aligner, has as compared to other multiple structural alignment programs on popular benchmark datasets. Applications include producing better training data for threading methods.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c6e578a124beecf4d052b271dc89ce5e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Computational biology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_879022c83c53456a84f74a1df9d63d14" level="item"><did><unittitle>An Exploration of Structure Learning in Bayesian Networks</unittitle><unitid>UA005.036.008.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Berzan, Constantin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_02a82fb8018e7cac4507b8b602bb7b3c">We start with a brief introduction to Bayesian networks. We provide an overview of learning Bayesian networks from data, and the different variations of this task. We then focus on the particular task of learning Bayesian network structure from fully observed data using a search-and-score approach. We discuss the Bayesian score and its implications, and survey the literature on existing structure-learning algorithms. We then develop two genetic algorithms for learning structure. The first algorithm searches over the space of graphs, and uses a specialized representation to ensure that the mutation and crossover operators are closed. The second algorithm searches over the space of node orders, and uses advanced caching and precomputation mechanisms to avoid repeated computations. We analyze the running time of the latter algorithm, including its caching and precomputation steps. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a structure-discovery task in the Genetic-Programming domain.

More specically, we are interested in whether or not core membership of an arbitrary point can be tested in polynomial time. This is motivated by the recent economic movement towards bounded rationality, which holds that a game theoretic  solution concept is poor if its justication relies on economic agents solving computationally infeasible problems.

Novel variants of the FRaC algorithm are presented, alongside mathematical justification and empirical evidence to support their use. mFRaC, eFRaC and cFRaC, are introduced here. These techniques have a focus on ensemblification, treating features equally, and handling missing values in samples. eFRaC and cFRaC are shown to be minor improvements on the traditional FRaC algorithm over UCI datasets by comparison of AUROC values.Additionally, several previously unknown properties of the FRaC algorithm are analyzed. The property of normalization-invariance is shown, given lenient assumptions. The properties of strong and weak self selection in feature modelling techniques are introduced, and FRaC is sown to have the weak self selection property under certain circumstances.
                Implementation details of the various statistical calculations necessitated by FRaC are also discussed. Original filter method based heuristic feature selection techniques are presented, alongside analysis and empirical evidence. A more conservative FRaC specific alternative to traditional filtering, termed partial filtering, is also introduced, and compared to traditional filtering.Finally, these algorithms are discussed in the context of the larger subfield of feature modelling anomaly detection techniques. The algorithms presented are broken into two categories, mathematical redefinitions of what constitutes an anomaly, and hyperparameter-reducing generalization algorithms. Additionally, further algorithms that were conceived but not implemented are described in this framework.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

This intuition has been corroborated experimentally, most reliably by studies that have found greater skin conductance responses (SCRs) in response to emotional phrases and taboo words in L1 than in L2, but the processing differences underlying this disparity remain unclear. In monolinguals, the late positive component (LPC) has been shown to be responsive to a word_�_s level of arousal (intensity) but not to its valence (pleasantness). The present study investigated how these dual aspects of a word_�_s emotionality are processed in L2. In Experiment 1, participants performed a semantic categorization task as they read single words that were crossed in levels of valence and arousal. As predicted, highly arousing words evoked a larger LPC than low arousal words in native English speakers but not in L2 English speakers, and no main effect of valence was observed in either group. Experiment 2 added taboo words to the same design. As with the arousal effects seen in Experiment 1, taboo words elicited a robust LPC compared to neutral words in native speakers, while the taboo effect was restricted in distribution in L2 speakers. However, no arousal effects were observed to highly arousing nontaboo words in either group when taboo words were present in the paradigm. These results suggest that L2 words are experienced as less arousing than L1 words and that arousal is relative to the surrounding context.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f5619f53732357c6762170b1b7e6451d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_8ba7653323a0e4b091785eb8ece10527" level="item"><did><unittitle>Glutamate hyperexcitability and aggression during withdrawal from escalated ethanol consumption in outbred male mice.</unittitle><unitid>UA005.037.003.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nathanson, Anna J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5acf01cd125b0a9bf3e50fbd6a8ed17b">Ethanol withdrawal syndrome, characterized by glutamatergic hyperexcitability in the brain, is a defining characteristic of alcohol dependence. Glutamate hyperexcitability and an upregulation of NMDA receptors have been observed in the brains of mice in withdrawal from ethanol consumption. The present study examined the effects of the uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist memantine on aggression during withdrawal from ethanol. Outbred Carworth Farm Webster (CFW) male mice were given intermittent, 2-bottle choice access to 20% w/v ethanol and water for ten weeks. CFW males voluntarily consumed ethanol, ranging from 5-20 grams/kilogram (g/kg) bodyweight in 24 hours over the 10 weeks of intermittent access. To measure alcohol withdrawal severity, handling-induced convulsion (HIC) scores were assessed every two hours during the ethanol withdrawal period. Outbred mice exhibited significantly greater HIC severity than water controls. In the same individuals, aggression during withdrawal was probed with a memantine or ketamine challenge to assess glutamate excitability. Resident CFW mice were injected with memantine (0, 3, 5, 10, or 30 mg/kg, i.p.) or ketamine (0, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and tested for aggression against an intruder at eight hours into withdrawal. Memantine significantly increased aggression in CFW mice during the withdrawal period, specifically at the 5 mg/kg dose, while ketamine did not significantly affect measures of aggression during ethanol withdrawal. These findings suggest that the uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist memantine, but not ketamine, biphasically increased withdrawal-related aggression in outbred CFW mice. Future studies will use microdialysis to examine glutamate levels in the mouse brain throughout the ethanol withdrawal period and will measure NMDA receptor regulation in the ethanol-withdrawn brain using immunohistological techniques.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b2b4fc787a2bb10a985d3b568b8148b3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_6f7af51c4f8ad35f4523c649b94efde1" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Neural Bases of Avian Visual Perception: Effects of Brain Lesions on Motion and Static Processing in Pigeons (Columba livia)</unittitle><unitid>UA005.037.004.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rothman, Gabriel R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e2041d081547837eccc4403c2431a117"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_f359e7a5e213380be2447dc9ca46f1c3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Previous research in pigeons has indicated that there might be functional segregations in visual processing between the anterior and posterior regions of the entopallium. We chose to investigate how these regions differentially process moving (dynamic) and non-moving (static) presentations of two human actions, Indian dance and martial arts. Six pigeons learned a go/no-go action categorization task, with reinforcement being conditional upon the presentation type. Three subjects received lesions to the posterior entopallium and three received lesions to the anterior entopallium. Posterior lesions impaired performance on both dynamic and static presentations, whereas anterior lesions had little, if any effect on performance in either presentation type. These results, along with prior studies, suggest that motion information is almost exclusively routed through the posterior entopallium, whereas static information is more widely distributed between both the
                anterior and posterior entopallium. Additionally, neither lesion had any detectable effect on categorization of these actions, which reveals that the entopallium as a whole is not critical for maintaining conceptual knowledge and is more important for building a percept of incoming visual information.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Despite its benefits, it seems that people rarely use CR to deal with stressful situations in their daily lives. The current study sought to encourage the use of CR in the context of daily life stressors using an expressive writing paradigm. Participants were 61 undergraduate and graduate students. Participants wrote about the most stressful event of their day on three consecutive days. They were randomly assigned to receive either CR writing instructions or Expressive Writing (EW) instructions. In addition, ambulatory physiological signals related to emotional arousal were measured for the duration of the study. It was predicted that participants in the CR group would experience less negative emotions immediately following writing, would show greater reductions in depression
                symptoms after the three-day writing period, and would experience less emotional arousal over the course of the study. Results show that negative mood increased significantly after writing in the EW group but not in the CR group. Depression scores in the CR group significantly decreased over the course of the study, while the EW group's scores did not, resulting in a significant difference between the two groups. There were no group differences in average galvanic skin response or skin temperature. The self-report results lend further support to the idea that writing about daily stress using cognitive reappraisal can lead to improved emotional well-being. However, the physiological null effect indicates that more research is needed to better understand the physiological mechanism underlying the perceived benefits conferred by CR writing.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Arctic environments are important locations for study as they are particularly sensitive to climate variations. Proglacial lake sediments, particularly varves, such as those found at Lake Linne, on the island of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, demonstrate this sensitivity as they are driven by glacial ablation. The correlation of cores from different locations in Lake Linne has served to address inconsistencies in the varve record across the lake. The relationship between measured varve thickness and weather parameters is based on meteorological records for the past century, and demonstrates the responsiveness of varves to changes in climate and weather. The strongest relationships between varves and weather were between positive degree estimates and varve thicknesses. Proximal locations showed the strongest values (r2 = .331), while summer thickness measurements at an intermediate deep basin site correlated best with the past two decades (r2 = .45). The measuring and counting of varves allowed the construction of a chronology that then serves as a climate proxy for Svalbard for the past century. The varve analysis from this study reveals the complexity of the sedimentation in Lake Linne, and it attempts to define the other likely factors that contribute to varve deposition. Overall, the assembled climate relationships reveal varves which can be linked to changes in weather and climate patterns, and a response of the Lake Linne proglacial system in the last two decades to climate change.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d66c831a916516c579ae167603c649d6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Climate Change</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_939c667b26dddc726f07e9993542a7f3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Morphology, Stratigraphic Distribution and Origin of Calcite Nodules from a Late Devonian Mixed Volcanic-Sedimentary Sequence, Southeastern Massachusetts</unittitle><unitid>UA005.038.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Marroquin, Selva M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7adea22ae5b0f70f321b61646ab7556b">In 2008 a unique sedimentary unit of red sandstone with abundant calcite nodules was discovered within the northeast corner of the Narragansett Basin in southeastern Massachusetts. Although the outcrop of the calcite nodules examined in this paper was destroyed in 2010, the nodules collected in 2008 were interpreted preliminarily as calcite rhizoliths representing a preserved root horizon (Benner and Gardulski, 2010). The calcite nodule-rich unit lies
                                stratigraphically below a dated rhyolite flow (Late Devonian, ~373 Ma; Thompson and Hermes, 2003) and is within the "lower portion" of the Wamsutta Formation, beneath an unconformity with the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks of the Wamsutta Formation. The outcrop area was investigated to determine whether the calcite features represent rhizoliths within a paleosol, possibly preserving an early, deeply rooted (~3m thick) plant ecosystem within a pyroclastic deposit.
                                Petrographic analysis revealed an abundance of devitrified glass within the matrix of these samples as well as pumice and lithic fragments suggesting a volcanic origin of the deposit. Scanning electron microscopy revealed amorphous carbon fragments within all of the sample types, which supports a biogenic origin of the calcite nodules. Combining this microscopic data with stratigraphic fieldwork it was confirmed that most of the calcite nodules are preserved
                                rhizoliths within a pyroclastic deposit from at least the Late Devonian.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_58f3594fd43039b1d0db52b41192651f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility was used to study tectonic deformation of the formation. Supporting previous work by Bailey et al. (1984), limited deformation was found in the form of shearing along bedding. Overall, the deformation was weak with low strain, though the degree of deformation varied throughout the study
                                area. At two sites laminated bedding was well preserved and there was an original sedimentary magnetic fabric. This fabric had its maximum susceptibility at a low angle to the nearly vertical bedding plane, suggesting a sedimentary imbrication. All other sites with a structural foliation showed some degree of sedimentary magnetic fabric reorientation as a result of tectonic deformation. These sites show maximum susceptibilities of samples spread on the structural

One site experienced greater deformation than others and the original sedimentary fabric is completely reoriented with maximum susceptibilities clustering as a weak lineation at ENE with a shallow plunge. Magnetic fabrics are consistent with bedding and foliation features seen in the field and can be used as a tool for structural analysis in locations where bedding or foliation cannot be clearly measured at an outcrop scale.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2cd3c71e2d98415d7ed1ddf5e3f99382"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Development of a comprehensive volcanic record, dependent on identifying volcanically deposited tephra layers preserved in hemipelagic sediment, is currently hindered by the lack of a rapid, non-destructive method of identifying cryptotephra (tephra layers invisible to the naked eye) in marine sediment cores. This work evaluates reflectance spectroscopy as a rapid, non-destructive method of identifying cryptotephra in ~7.5 m of marine core drilled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) mission 340 at site U1396 (IODP E340-PR). Vis-NIR [0.4-2.5 m] reflectance spectra were collected at 0.5 cm down-core resolution using an ASD Fieldspec� spectrometer, and locations of potential
                cryptotephra layers identified using spectral summary parameters sensitive to iron content (0.95 m integrated band depth) and clay minerals (2.202 m band depth) (McCanta et al., 2014). Component analysis of the volcanic sediment fraction found at these locations reveals that spectral signatures indicative of tephra correlate with increased percentages of pumice and juvenile/angular volcanic materials likely emplaced by explosive eruptions. This suggests that reflectance spectroscopy is an effective means of identifying cryptotephra in situ. When employed in concert with other core scanning techniques, Vis/NIR spectroscopy could facilitate rapid shipboard identification of cryptotephra on future IODP missions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Accurate relative sea-level reconstructions calibrate Earth-ice models that are used in analyzing global satellite data such as data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and provide context for modern sea-level change. Foraminifera from a core of salt-marsh peat taken above the current high tide line were used as sea-level indicators to reconstruct relative sea level along the southern coast of the White Sea in northwestern Russia. Analysis of modern salt-marsh foraminifera show a marsh dominated by two species: Balticammina pseudomacrescens in the high marsh and Miliammina spp. in the lower marsh. Partitioning around medoids statistical analysis shows four primary groups of foraminifera and their relationship to mean tide level, representing high marsh, low marsh, sub-tidal, and freshwater upland ecological zones. Analysis of foraminifera in the core
                show an abundance of B. pseudomacrescens, placing core samples into the high marsh zone. Relative sea level was calculated to be 2.33 � 0.59 m higher than it is today, indicating relative sea level fall. Radiocarbon dates from plant samples above and below the analyzed marsh samples in the core constrained the sea level change to 2804 � 52 years before present (BP; 1950AD). Comparing these data to a predicted sea level curve shows a lower than expected relative sea level. This may be due to local effects such as tectonics or subsidence, or to an inconsistency with the assumed mantle characteristics indicating that a reevaluation of mantle properties may be necessary.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),  'outreach' was a response to lack of public knowledge and misinformation about the Tribunal's work in the former Yugoslavia.  Outreach has since been expanded to include not only provision of information, but facilitating a two-way communication of engagement between the court and the public. In this thesis I focus on outreach at the War Crimes Chamber in Bosnia-Herzegovina (WCC).  The WCC was established in 2003 to prosecute war crimes committed during the conflict in Bosnia from 1992-1995. Included in the establishment of the War Crimes Chamber was a Public Information and Outreach Section (PIOS).  This section was intended to foster a two-way communication, however, I find that PIOS has not succeeded in engaging the public.  Informed by analysis of the origin of outreach at the ICTY, theoretical models of outreach, and the implementation of outreach strategies at hybrid courts in East-Timor, Sierra Leone, and Cambodia, I identify the factors that have inhibited the implementation of outreach at the WCC.  These factors are a lack of institutional commitment and the failure of PIOS to develop a detailed and coherent strategy.  After identifying these factors I recommend actions that could improve outreach at the WCC.   In conclusion I expand my analysis to identify factors that should be considered in designing outreach strategies for future hybrid courts.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1d8cc69834f567a74fe9e45c067849bc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Peace and Justice Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2493b3c00cebc6df3f38802519ac2c29" level="item"><did><unittitle>Uno de las cosas que uno se aprende aquí: The impact of immigration to the United States on Dominican acceptance of Haitians</unittitle><unitid>UA005.039.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fusco, Elizabeth</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6fe778a54796c4dc65403aa29851568f">The people of the Dominican Republic and Haiti have a tenuous relationship, and the approximately 500,000 Haitian migrants and their descendants living in the Dominican Republic face social and economic discrimination.  In order to mitigate discrimination and mistreatment of Haitian immigrants and ease the tension between the two peoples, it is crucial to have a greater understanding of whether and how anti-Haitian sentiments among Dominicans can change.  This paper is based on primary and secondary research methods to discuss the development of the anti-Haitian narrative in Dominican history, and the dynamics of the Dominican immigrant population in the United States.  Dominican Americans were then interviewed as a test case to explore whether the unique circumstances brought about by immigration can change opinions.  In the sample interviewed, the experience of discrimination and cultural adaptation as an immigrant in the United States did contribute to a feeling that Haitians should not be prejudiced against.  While few in the sample thought that reconciliation or greater rights for Haitians in the Dominican Republic were possible, this research indicates that the anti-Haitian sentiment in the Dominican Republic can change through exposure to new ideas and experiences.

This new and explicit goal to stimulate civic dialogue has in turn uprooted traditional art processes largely concerned with personal self-expression or adherence to standards of aesthetics.  With critical engagement from the community at the core of artists' goals, experimentation with the arts' location, project planning and the role of citizen participation has emerged.  Escaping definitive classification and encouraging debate, community-based art endeavors executed in the public sphere appear to be a locus of potential social progress. I propose that this genre of public artwork can be employed as a reconciliatory mechanism in response to community conflict.  Specifically, my supposition will center on underserved urban communities in the United States.  My investigation is designed around the discussion topics of site location, contested ownership of public space and management of community dialogue.  I demonstrate the complexity of site-specificity by tracking how artists or citizens determine the location of a work, the historical relationship of the space to the artist or message, and if the location has an impact on the art product.  Second, I utilize the symbiotic relationship between public space and public art, declaring the impact of community ownership integral to the success of the overall attempt towards social progress.  Finally, my argument is immersed in the didactic of community dialogue.  The set of questions that have emerged from this analysis will aid in guiding artists who are working on public art projects.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_072827783a8d8d9ac27254f36da9736c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Program in Peace and Justice Studies</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2d3ee01b00a787aafb1bec219e870056" level="item"><did><unittitle>Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Experiential Education</unittitle><unitid>UA005.039.009.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Borow, Amanda C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e014f3c79b823bcd4f34e39f25411ad0">Experiential Education is a pedagogical approach that facilitates student learning through reflection on active experience. Each student constructs knowledge based on his or her own interpretation of an experience through his or her unique frame of reference; consequently, each student's learning outcomes are personal and varied. Given this core aspect of experiential education, assessment and evaluation of student learning within an experiential education program is challenging. I will examine the assessment of student learning at the Courageous Sailing Youth Summer Program in order to explore the role of assessment and evaluation in experiential education. First I will develop a critical framework that includes the theoretical foundations and contemporary models of experiential education; I will additionally outline assessment and evaluation structures  Traditional Summative Outcomes assessment and Participatory Formative Process assessment - within the context of experiential education. Utilizing this framework, I will critically analyze my initial Traditional Summative Outcomes approach to assess student learning in the Courageous Sailing Summer Youth Program in the summer of 2012. Finally, I will propose a Participatory Formative Process evaluation strategy for Courageous that will structure and facilitate student learning and encourage the ongoing development of Courageous as an experiential education program.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5bcded9bf1291a721cb6bccc2456c2af"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in Peace and Justice Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_42b818fdbc97b52e4f19ee36ddf1a51c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Environmental Conflict: What's gender got to do with it?</unittitle><unitid>UA005.039.010.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Weiner, Arlen R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_17bc4dd70094b87bf28bac9efa68ffb5">Feminist security scholars have argued that conflict and peace are gendered activities and gender must be incorporated more systematically into conflict analyses. However, the examination of gender has been largely absent in environmental conflict literature. Through an analysis of two case studiesthe Cauvery River dispute in India and pastoralist conflicts in Turkana, Kenyathis thesis explores the gender impacts of each conflict, the gender symbolism of the natural resources parties are fighting over, and the structure of gender in society and government. The ultimate goal of the research is to bridge the gap between two sets of conflict analyses and provide a more comprehensive view of environmental security. This thesis concludes that a better understanding of the relationship between gender and environmental management is necessary for designing effective policies and programs for environmental sustainability by promoting involvement of all stakeholders. If environmental management is key for preventing conflicts, then a gender-neutral policy approach to environmental conflict is flawed from the outset. Gender mainstreaming in environmental conflicts is a necessary policy prescription for achieving sustainable peace and security and promoting gender equality and women's empowerment.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_778875ba7546b21048a3eee3592591bb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Program in Peace and Justice Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fb84992876b2d85b99c85395592d38e4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Cyber Warfare: Changing the Reality of Warfare Capabilities in the 21st Century</unittitle><unitid>UA005.039.011.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kolodner, Alexander R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_32fc9c7b0829488d492bb2f7ad33caf1">Analyzing war principles through the lens of cyber warfare.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b49c9d8ee5df70e5f1977eca01620b4f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

For some applications, a lighter concrete may be needed; therefore, use of a lightweight aggregate is an often-chosen replacement for traditional aggregates.  A potential lightweight aggregate is synthetic lightweight aggregates (SLAs) produced by commingling two waste streams - coal fly ash and mixed plastics - to create a granular material similar in size to natural sand and gravel. However, the presence of trace contaminants in the fly ash presents an obstacle to increased fly ash reuse.  The goal of this study was to demonstrate the reduction in leachability for arsenic, lead, and selenium; all common trace contaminants in fly ash, via use of the fly ash in SLAs.  It was hypothesized that the waste plastic in SLAs could serve to mitigate contaminant leaching from fly ash - as found in previous research on the  use of plastics to reduce leaching of contaminants from municipal solid waste combustion products (Massardier etal, 1997). Two varieties of fly ash were tested: a high carbon "Raw" ash and a low carbon "Processed" ash, created from a carbon burn-out unit. Aggregates were created with ash-to-plastic ratios (by weight) of 0:100, 20:80, 50:50, and 80:20. These aggregates and the ashes were tested for toxin leaching using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure. Arsenic levels were measured using a graphite furnace atomic absorption (GFAA) device and lead and selenium levels were measured using a Leeman Labs PS-1000 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) unit.  Additional exploration into the mechanism of toxin leaching involved segregating the fly ash and creating aggregate with ash specimens with a known range of particle sizes. This process allowed the effect on unburned carbon on toxin leachability to be observed. Leaching was carried out on these aggregates and levels of lead and selenium were measured. The structure of various sizes of these aggregates was also observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Results from these tests supported the hypothesis that inclusion of the ash into synthetic lightweight aggregates reduced its leachability. In most cases, and particularly those with a low pH, this reduction was significant; reductions of up to 96.69% were achieved for arsenic, 96.94% for selenium, and 80.58% for lead. Therefore, in cases where the leaching of toxins is a large concern, utilization of fly ash in synthetic lightweight aggregates, rather than as ash alone, provides a beneficial ash reuse strategy.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f0328d851c68f68c5bf8a85cf0828ce7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6f83d30f5d33ceea5c8d6e9fbf22bf34" level="item"><did><unittitle>Teaching Understanding in the Context of Structural Engineering</unittitle><unitid>UA005.040.006.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hogan, Rachael A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c7e090ea4f07a3547fcbd9a487c8d5eb">The goal of this research project is to analyze different teaching methods that are effective in encouraging true understanding of fundamental concepts.  The hypothesis is that teaching methods seriously influence a student's ability to gain true understanding, especially in the field of structural engineering.  Two systems of key factors are identified as the basis for this theory.  The first involves the balance of showing physical relationships, creating intimate learning environments, and presenting role models.  The second system includes identifying student preconceptions, developing expertise, and using a metacognitive approach.  If all of these components were incorporated into courses, students would develop or maintain the motivation to truly understand concepts they are learning.  The validity of this hypothesis has been tested over the course of the academic year in two different courses.  The first, Structural Art, was a first-year elective.  During this course, a small laboratory section was taught with a focus on learning fundamental concepts of structural analysis through methods illustrated in Figure 3.  The second was Introduction to Civil Engineering, taught to sophomores during the spring semester.  In this course, the laboratory was based on the students own designs of structural systems that could be analyzed using theory learned in lecture.  In both cases, a strong focus was placed on encouraging the students to relate the complex theories they were learning to examples that they understood on a physical level.  The intended outcome of this research is to show that, in general, students develop a true understanding of material when the teaching methods outlined in Figures 1 and 3 are employed.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b918c3365790f33e150380cdcdc3dec0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5d7628e6efc2926895ef219b1bfd6bb8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Fate and Transport of Nanoscale Buckminsterfullerene Aggregates (nC60) in Heterogenous Porous Media</unittitle><unitid>UA005.040.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wolfand, Jordyn Michelle</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8fdcc5337eb25d7ebad7abe8cb1bf5c5">Buckminsterfullerene (C60), an allotrope of carbon, has unique physical and chemical properties that have led to its use in a variety of commercial applications, ranging from organic photovoltaics to biopharmaceuticals. It is inevitable that C60 will be released into the environment during manufacture, transportation, application, and disposal. C60 is nearly insoluble in water, though several methods have been developed to disperse C60 aggregates in water without the aid of stabilizing agents. These C60 aggregates have diameters of 5–200 nm, are negatively charged, and are referred to as nC60. It has been suggested that nC60 is the most environmentally relevant form of C60, but understanding of the retention and transport of these particles in heterogeneous is limited. This research sought to characterize the transport and retention behavior of nC60 in a two-dimensional (2-d) aquifer cell packed with heterogeneous porous media. It was hypothesized that nC60 would accumulate at the interfaces between high and low permeability sands.  Initially, two sets of one-dimensional (1-d) column experiments were completed to prepare for injection into the 2-d aquifer cell, and to determine parameters needed to simulate transport of nC60 with modified filtration theory. The first series of column studies was conducted to determine a background electrolyte that would result in 75% breakthrough of nC60 after a pulse injection into the 40/50 mesh sand matrix. A second series of 1-d column experiments was completed at the optimal electrolyte concentration to determine two parameters needed for simulation by modified filtration theory – maximum retention capacity (Smax), and the particle attachment rate (Katt) of the porous medium. After determination of the relevant transport parameters in the 1-d column studies, nC60 was injected into the 2-d aquifer cell. nC60 breakthrough was found to increase with an increase in ionic strength of the background electrolyte, in accordance with previous literature. 6 mM NaCl and 0.05 mM NaHCO3 was chosen as the background electrolyte for the 2-d cell. Smax was determined to be 0.57, 3.17, and 0.54, 3.2, and 4.7 ?g/g, and katt was found to be 0.25, 1.1, and 1.4 h-1 for 40/50, 80/100, and 100/140 mesh natural Ottawa sand, respectively.  nC60 was injected separately into three of the ports of the 2-d aquifer cell (upstream of a 80/100 mesh low-permeability lens, upstream of a 100/140 mesh low-permeability lens, and in the background matrix of 40/50 mesh sand. A significant amount of nC60 mass was retained near the port of injection. Enhanced accumulation of sorbed-phase nC60 at the textural interface did not occur as expected. Though sorbed-phase concentration of nC60 decreased after the interface, accumulation did not occur on the horizontal boundaries of the lens. Results indicate that nC60 transport at textural interfaces is controlled by changes in local flow velocities through heterogeneous media.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3b49321272ce6d3cc99ca4976db83e0a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Chemical engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ba8b78922c10a1b0d9537feecbc4a4be" level="item"><did><unittitle>Understanding the Role of Metal Solubility in Controlled Release of Alkalinity from Particle-Containing, Oil-in-Water Emulsions</unittitle><unitid>UA005.040.008.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Leach, Olivia Isabel Morris</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_de263908c52af923aa721bf4fc5bc2b3">Remediation of contaminants in the subsurface is a key environmental issue. Due to its noninvasive and cost-effective approach, an increasingly common method of subsurface cleanup is bioremediation, in which naturally-occurring microbes are stimulated to transform contaminants into benign or immobile substances. In order to create a favorable environment for these microbes, there are many factors that must be carefully controlled; these include sources of carbon, energy and nutrient availability, temperature, and pH. In situ bioremediation requires that these conditions be manipulated within the subsurface. Traditional subsurface alkalinity control methods are hindered by limited mixing and dispersion in the subsurface. Oil-in-water emulsions have potential as an in situ alkalinity release and delivery system; however the mechanisms that control this alkalinity release are not well documented.  The goal of this project was to examine how the chemistry of oil-in-water emulsions can be manipulated in order to control alkalinity release in the subsurface. The key hypothesis was that increasing oil polarity will increase the solubility of particles in oil, and thereby increase the thermodynamic force of partitioning into the aqueous phase.  Experimental methods were divided into three main objectives: stability, alkalinity release, and solubility experiments. A spectrophotometer was used to assess the stability of MgO and CaCO3 particles in oil. Batch experiments were used to assess both the solubility of these particles in oil and the alkalinity release rate of these particles as a function of oil polarity. Data suggests that both MgO and CaCO3 particles display sufficient stability in soybean oil for encapsulation within emulsions, and that increasing the oil polarity increases the rate of alkalinity release into the aqueous phase. Results also indicate some evidence of particle solubility increasing as a function of oil polarity; however, these solubility experiments require refinement.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e394af573c5ff11c6a03767d043dad2d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Hazardous waste site remediation</subject><subject source="local">Oil pollution of water</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f1a9b01d8f004b34b452104aab20a239" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Intervention Point: Cholera Prevention in Urban and Rural Bangladesh</unittitle><unitid>UA005.040.009.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Majumder, Maimuna Shahnaz</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_476266354557784ae301bdbba3263dfb">Annually, 3 to 5 million individuals contract cholera, an acute diarrheal infection that is caused by ingestion of food or water that contains the Vibrio cholerae bacteria. Because cholera is a waterborne disease, it can be transmitted quickly in environments with inadequate sewage and sanitation systems where infected waste can easily contaminate drinking water. The adequacy of water and sanitation infrastructure and socioeconomic status are crucial factors in influencing the transmission of cholera. As a result of such infrastructure deficiencies, Bangladesh continues to struggle with endemic cholera, reporting upwards of 1 million cases yearly. Such disease burden results in incalculable lost wages and treatment expenses, extracted from an already impoverished society. In the face of such severe economic consequences, prevention strategies must be advanced in order for cholera control sustainability.

This paper uses the existing literature to formulate hypotheses regarding the most effective intervention point for preventing cholera in urban and rural Bangladesh. Then, by analyzing cholera incidence data obtained from the International Centre of Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh in Dhaka (urban location) and Matlab (rural location), conclusions are drawn regarding which individual attributes contribute most to cholera contraction. The individual attributes serve as surrogates for three primary determinants of cholera: water, sanitation, and socioeconomic status. By understanding what attributes makes individuals most susceptible to cholera, one may begin to understand what determinant makes the given population most susceptible. Such knowledge is invaluable to identifying the most effective intervention points for preventing cholera in urban and rural Bangladesh.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0109a96c2d71671eea1332764b9cc6b5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_25eab824e28f1c8005e922d352468a60" level="item"><did><unittitle>Determining the Partitioning of Chlorinated Solvents into Soybean Oil used during Remediation of DNAPL Source Zones </unittitle><unitid>UA005.040.010.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wilburn, Eric Beyer</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4829a1a9b6f008901f552261f7e92bb3">One of the most commonly detected classes of contaminants in the subsurface is chlorinated solvents. Chlorinated solvents undergo limited natural degradation in the subsurface. Enhanced in situ biodegradation is an effective treatment for subsurface environments contaminated by chlorinated solvents. Enhanced biodegradation of chlorinated solvents involves metabolic reductive dechlorination, which is a strictly anaerobic, energy-deriving, process that couples the oxidation of an electron donor to the sequential reduction of chlorinated contaminants (tetrachloroethene (PCE) __� trichloroethene (TCE) __� cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) __� vinyl chloride (VC) __� ethane). The biological process relies upon the injection of fermentable substrate to produce the reducing equivalents needed by the anaerobic bacteria. 	
\
A major unknown related to engineering applications of metabolic reductive dechlorination is the fate and transport of degradation products within the multiphase environment comprising aqueous and organic phases.  The addition of emulsified oils (substrate) to the subsurface essentially creates zones of NAPL, albeit vegetable oil NAPL.  The main hypothesis of this research is the emulsified oil phase can sequester contaminants and degradation products within the subsurface. Any such sequestration would obscure engineering interpretations related to the accumulation of cis-DCE and VC, which are more toxic and indicative of incomplete dechlorination.  Moreover, knowledge of the mass of all degradation products formed during bioremediation is critical when assessing the extent and kinetics of degradation.  
\
This study elucidates the equilibrium partitioning of three chlorinated solvents/degradation products (PCE, TCE and cis-DCE) between a representative vegetable oil (soybean oil) and the aqueous phase.  Equilibrium experiments were completed and then analyzed for behavior over environmentally relevant concentrations of these chlorinated solvents. Deviations from ideal solution theory (Raoult_�_s Law Analogy) were identified at low concentration in all systems.  Dilute regions for PCE, TCE and cis-DCE extend from zero concentration up to approximately 175 mg/L, 400 mg/L, and 2250 mg/L respectively. Partitioning within these dilute regions was modeled using Henry_�_s Law, with partition coefficients (mole-fraction basis) of (2.20�� 0.155)�_�105, (3.37��0.178)�_�103, and (1.33��0.03)�_�103 (i.e., XCSDP in Organic Phase/XCSDP in Aqueous Phase) at 22 �� 2��C for PCE, TCE, and cis-DCE, respectively.  Future efforts should focus on extending these measurements into the more concentrated region which will permit more rigorous modeling of the liquid-liquid equilibrium using excess free energy models.

Due to their small size, UFP may have more adverse health impacts than larger particles.  The concentration of UFP can vary widely over a small area, especially in an urban setting, so many monitoring locations are necessary to accurately estimate UFP concentrations on an urban scale.  Because of this, a model of particle number concentration (PNC; a proxy for UFP) based on mobile monitoring data can present a less costly alternative for estimating UFP levels than deploying a monitoring network.  Wind is known to have an effect on PNC, so it is important that any model of PNC with high temporal resolution include an effective wind variable.  Because wind is a vector quantity (has both direction and magnitude), it can be difficult to represent in a model.  Many air pollution models entirely omit the effects of wind or only include wind speed as a variable. The objectives of this thesis were (1) investigate a suite of different wind variables used in air pollution modeling by including them in multiple linear regressions of PNC, (2) compare the regressions using goodness-of-fit statistics such as adjusted R2, and (3) validate the regressions by using regression diagnostics to determine whether modeling assumptions were met.  To investigate the relative merits of different wind variables, a multiple linear regression of the logarithm of hourly PNC (Adj. R2 = 0.22) was augmented with one of four types of wind variables: wind speed, wind sectors, a vector-based variable, or a Fourier-based variable.  Wind sectors based on wind direction relative to the highway performed best (Adj. R2 > 0.30), while the vector-based variables performed poorly (Adj. R2 < 0.25; less than wind speed alone).  The wind sectors may have performed better than vector-based variables because only one weather station was used, which meant that local turbulence was not accounted for, thus leading to incorrect wind direction input to the vector variables.  The highway-relative wind sectors may have performed better than the conventional sectors because they took the effect of the highway, which is considered to be a major source of UFP within the study area, into account.  The findings from this research will inform a regression model of PNC that will aid in assessing exposure to UFP for the study participants of CAFEH.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4c2678c8380376da4a602c1ba5f174a5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_2f9400d8119bec221f6b8704e8a508a4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Vertical Distribution of Particulate Matter in a Near-highway Urban Area</unittitle><unitid>UA005.040.012.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">MacNaughto, Piers Iain Ivo Octa</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5c051dc4427e09302271d6faa98bd4bb">This thesis describes research to better understand vertical profiles of particle number count and mass concentration of particles less than 2.5 ��m in diameter (PM2.5) near Interstate 93 in Boston, Massachusetts. These profiles can be used to help estimate particulate matter exposure to people who live or work several stories above ground-level. Although vertical profiles of particulate matter have been collected near major roadways in previous studies, none have been collected with as fine a spatial resolution and over as wide a range of meteorological conditions. The profiles were collected with a pulley system that lifted the instruments, leading to a continuous sampling of the vertical profiles. The vertical profiles are analyzed in conjunction with meteorological conditions, the source strength of the highway, and building density and height to obtain a qualitative assessment of each variable_�_s effect on the magnitude and the slope of the particle profiles. The meteorological conditions considered in this thesis are wind direction and speed, temperature, and relative humidity on both a short and long timescale. The magnitude of the particle number count and PM2.5 is primarily dependent on the source strength and the diurnal temperature cycle. The slope of the particle number count profile depends on the vertical temperature profile, whereas PM2.5 remains constant with height. The profiles do not demonstrate a significant decline with height; therefore, exposure to particulate matter up to eight stories high should not be dismissed as an exposure pathway.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_93c710b443ee74d15dd03820d6515eb3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_e4d08828a956f0c86a2a1fe6658ccc33" level="item"><did><unittitle>Seasonal variation of emission factors for ultrafine particles from on-highway vehicles</unittitle><unitid>UA005.040.013.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Milando, Chad</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c5154d5caa59ac5c7a7ed1241213e299">As urban populations increase, the need to estimate urban exposure to harmful aerosols increases. Simple Gaussian screening models can provide initial exposure estimates, but urban environments can create complex wind fields that exceed the capabilities of simple models. To fill this need, sophisticated models, such as the Quick Urban &amp; Industrial Complex (QUIC) dispersion model, have been developed to model pollutant flow through urban environments. One pollutant of recent concern is ultrafine particles (UFP), particles whose diameter is less than 100 nm, and vehicle emission factors (EF) have been developed for UFP, in units of # of UFP/vehicle-km. The validity of urban exposure estimates depends on the predictive capacity of the EF estimate, and it is unclear if an EF estimate generated from average annual data can be used to adequately predict UFP concentrations at all times during a year. The goal of this research was to examine if an EF estimate that allowed average annual monitored data, collected in Ten Hills, MA, to fall within a factor-of-2 of QUIC model predictions could be used to adequately predict UFP concentrations in the summer and winter months (June through August and December through February, respectively). Monitored concentrations along Temple Road, a road orthogonal to highway I-93 (the main source of UFP in Ten Hills), were compared to QUIC predicted UFP concentrations. For data collected from hours where the prevailing wind direction was from the southwest (i.e., orthogonal to I-93), an EF of 5*1014 #/veh-km captured 92% of the annual average data within a factor-of-2 estimate, 68% of the summer data, and 52% of the winter data. When the prevailing wind direction was from the northwest (parallel to I-93), an EF estimate of 5*1014 #/veh-km captured 91% of the annual average data within a factor-of-2 estimate, 50% of the summer data, and 60% of the winter data. The impact of varying the EF based on the season was also investigated. Measured concentrations of UFPs were higher in the winter than in the summer, and varying the UFP EF with season greatly improved the amount of data captured by the factor-of-2 envelope from model estimates. The results of this research highlight the modeling capacity of QUIC, and show that season-sensitive EF estimates could generate more accurate UFP exposure estimates.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1dd2621dbd6ad8b69c71113db53e6fb9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject><subject source="local">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2f28074a966ac41cd9d527c5741e8a13" level="item"><did><unittitle>Analysis of Airborne Particulate Matter Concentrations During Rainstorms in Boston, Massachusetts</unittitle><unitid>UA005.040.014.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shapero, Andrew D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e50e0b82c34a4ec5448f2ed447035262">Even though there is precipitation in Boston an average of 127 days out of the year, there have been few efforts to measure particulate air pollution during rainstorms in Boston. During rainstorms, particle number concentration (PNC), which is an air pollutant associated with cardiovascular disease, and meteorological conditions both change. It is unclear, however, if the rainfall itself or the changes in meteorological conditions cause PNC to change. The
                                objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify the changes in PNC, temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction during rainstorms; (2) to construct a multivariate linear regression model to determine how PNC is associated with rainstorm duration; and (3) to determine which meteorological conditions are associated with changes in PNC during rainstorms. The study was performed at the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
                                Protection (MassDEP) Air Pollution Monitoring Site in Roxbury, Massachusetts. PNC and meteorological conditions (temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall rate) were measured at five-minute intervals from September 9, 2013 through March 12, 2014. A multivariate linear regression model and a time series of rainstorms were constructed. Average PNC during rainy weather was measured to be 8% less than average PNC
                                during dry weather (p&lt;0.001). In general, PNC levels decreased throughout rainstorms at a rate of 15%/hour. A multivariate linear regression model estimated that rainfall was associated with PNC removal at an average rate of 12%/hour. A comparison of the simple linear regression model and the multivariate linear regression model indicated that the decrease in PNC associated with rainfall duration is associated with the rainfall itself and not other

Chlorinating water is one form of household water treatment that has been proven to be effective at disinfecting water; however, there is uncertainty in the ability of chlorine to effectively disinfect turbid waters. Turbid waters tend to have a larger chlorine demand, and particulate matter in turbid waters can
                                shield microorganisms from disinfection. A double dose (3.75 mg/L) of chlorine is recommended in turbid waters. This research investigated the chlorine demand and microbiological disinfection of turbid waters with 10, 100 and 300 NTU and 0, 2, 10, and 25 mg/L of additional total organic carbon (TOC) when a double dose of chlorine was applied.

Many of these people also meet their daily water needs from surface waters that are susceptible to open defecation; thus, there is a great risk that these waters may be contaminated by waterborne pathogens. We have combined two well-established models: a pathogen fate and transport model and an epidemic model to predict the outbreak and
                                progression of diseases caused by waterborne pathogens along an urbanized river channel. The fate and transport model predicts the transport and evolution of the pathogen in the river system, and the epidemic model predicts the outbreak of the disease once populations along the river have ingested that contaminated water. The communities then act as pseudo-incubators for the disease, effectively increasing the amount of pathogen in the river channel. A combined
                                model provides a more holistic view of the waterborne infectious disease paradigm through the inclusion of a river and a human population component. We provide a case study for this model by examining the Cholera outbreak in Haiti in October 2010, and calibrating the model to the Artibonite River that runs through Haiti. This case study has provided confirmation of our model results to a certain extent. The model can serve as a decision support system to determine
                                the best management practice and public health interventions, and also may be used to in guiding response to bioterrorism attacks. If used effectively, these hydroepidemiological models will lead to improved access to safe water and sanitation worldwide by serving as a tool to educate and guide decision making for water resource engineers and public health practitioners alike.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_652809dbf1b8c9216c9b8d5ea43aa18b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts Univeristy.

TCE and PCE have been found to increase the risk for human health impacts at a concentration of 5 micrograms per liter when ingested in water and have been classified as potential or actual human carcinogens by the USEPA. Bioremediation involves natural subsurface microbes and has the potential of reducing the toxicity of chlorinated solvents by reductive dechlorination, which breaks down the chlorinated solvents to harmless ethene.Previous studies performed in abiotic sand-packed columns have shown that certain short-chain fatty acids persist much longer in contaminant zones than soluble that does not readily mix with contaminant. These results demonstrated that these fatty acids partitioned in and out of the contaminant and could potentially provide a sustained source of fermentable

Biotic batch reactors were used to test the effectiveness of potential PEDs compared to lactate, a common electron donor. The results for this study show that short fatty acids, n-butyl acetate and isopropryl propionate are potential partitioning electron donors that support microbial reductive dechlorination. The potential PED that did not support the microbial community was 2-ethyl-1-hexanol.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Ultimately, I demonstrate that social networks are essential to both male and female immigrants during the initial settlement process for finding jobs and places to live. Later on, social networks have both benefits and drawbacks for all immigrants, but men and women react to the drawbacks differently. The men I interviewed intentionally isolated themselves and retained only amistades (acquaintances), while the women chose to seek and maintain intimate ties with amigos (friends). 
\
In this study, men often perceived a downward shift in status upon arrival due to gender norms that challenged their hegemonic dominance (machismo), while women described feeling more independent in this country. When confronted by cultural norms that conflicted with their own in the host society, men and women employed divergent strategies to maintain their self-esteem and independence. Overall, women expressed a commitment to staying in this country while men relied on the vague notion that they would soon return home. Women_�_s commitments to staying in this country and establishing roots here facilitated their formations of social networks, while men_�_s commitment to the _��myth of return_�� made them unwilling to invest financially or emotionally in this country. Ultimately, while trusting relationships with amigos were not essential to everyday survival, they provided healthy outlets for dealing with traumas that were common to the wage-labor migration experience in Boston.

Many of the health reforms necessary to address these medical challenges require reconfigurations of economies and healthcare infrastructures. However, some disparities have short-term and affordable solutions, such as those related to cataract surgery. In order to examine how cataract surgery can be expanded in different developmental climates, this study examined cataract surgery patterns in Guatemala, Cuba, and Spain. As an interdisciplinary study, this analysis draws upon resources from several different disciplines in an effort to understand the unique features of cataract surgery in each country. We found that each state needs to expand cataract surgery, taking into account each country's particular social, cultural, and economic features; recommendations were made accordingly. Specifically, to expand cataract surgery, Guatemala should bridge the gap between biomedicine and ethnomedicine, Spain needs to collaborate internationally with Latin American surgical providers, and Cuba needs to open up its privatized medical services to its citizens. In addition, these countries should capitalize upon historical, cultural, and economic connections to foster medical exchange. In synthesis, this study finds that cataract surgery expansion must be planned and tailored according to the specific needs of its setting. Governments, NGO's, and providers in general need to make serious investments in understanding local climate in order to expand and develop cataract surgery within that climate  These findings are consistent with global problems in uptake related to cataract surgery and biomedical interventions in general. Although important, the results of this study should not represent the end of investigation in this field and this research should be used as model for the necessarily interdisciplinary nature of tackling global health disparities.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_70a9f48914cacb88868fb5ab1140b229"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0eb4236a2560fea0f624067fe5d5e7e2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Investigating Student Epistemologies in Physics 11 at Tufts University</unittitle><unitid>UA005.043.002.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sypek, Mary C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ffa2aeedb3c6ae8c92b3a53cd719ce15">Student epistemologies in Physics, their ideas about knowing and what kinds of knowledge are valuable, affect learning and have been the subject of many recent reforms in Physics education. This project is an investigation into student epistemologies in a reformed introductory Physics course at Tufts University. I interviewed fifteen students between four and sixteen months after completing Physics 11 at Tufts, and used their words to find evidence of their epistemologies about Physics. I found that students who understood the epistemological goals of the course generally also liked the course, and students who did not understand these goals generally did not like the course. Underneath these general classifications, I found some more specific, focused variability in student epistemologies, which is the subject of the second conjecture.

Ideally, students act as language models and language learners by turns, thereby creating symmetrical
                                immersive environments in each language. TWI has been regarded by experts as the most effective and culturally sensitive means by which to develop bilingual proficiency while simultaneously condoning high levels of academic achievement, allowing students to apply concepts and skills developed in their first language to the second. The present study draws upon data collected through a combination of classroom observations and teacher interviews conducted in the
                                first grade classrooms of a Spanish-English TWI program in order to compare the theoretical ideal of the TWI model with the practical realities of bilingual instruction. Contrary to what one would expect, results indicate that 1) there existed substantive differences in instruction between the two program languages, and 2) the students collectively possessed a lower proficiency in the minority language. The study interprets the findings in light of the linguistic
                                and pedagogical theories underlying TWI and supports research suggesting areas for further investigation with regard to the school- and classroom-level frameworks necessary to promote bilingual proficiency in all students.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d0569d7b1986560e55d6e0714deeaea9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Corner stores are often locally-owned businesses that are already equipped for food retail and are already frequented by neighborhood residents, making them more responsive to community preferences and more cost-effective than
                                supermarket attraction strategies. Accordingly, cities and organizations are implementing "healthy corner store programs" to support the stores in selling healthy food, improving neighborhood livability and local business development. Based on a literature review and practitioner interviews, I assess the strengths and challenges of healthy corner store programs, review policy and planning tools to support these programs, and propose program evaluation methods to
                                measure their outcomes. I find that most healthy corner store programs are still in initial phases, inviting innovation and expansion in coming years, which would be bolstered by more rigorous program evaluations. These initiatives can have most significant impacts as part of larger multi-pronged strategies to increase food access, and would be more institutionally sustainable if policy or planning approaches eventually replaced current resource-intensive

Beyond providing an interesting reflection of diverse cultural values and practices, this variation has a direct impact on the experiences of children in multicultural classrooms. Storytelling is a valuable way in which many skills and much knowledge are developed in school. However, many teachers are only aware of the culturally dominant school-based narrative style, and therefore are not able to properly understand and work with the narratives told by students of non-dominant cultures. While this has become a well-recognized issue in the field of discourse analysis and education, it is still unaddressed in many classrooms today. This study presents the case of a particularly diverse preschool classroom and one enthusiastic storyteller whose style does not
                match the dominant narrative expectations. An analysis of his stories and the literary skills he is developing are presented, followed by a discussion of his school setting and the implications of diverse narrative styles in multicultural classrooms.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Yet public understanding of climate change is poor, especially among children. So from where does our understanding of climate change come? At over 10-hours of media content consumed by children each day the majority from televisual media it is clear much of our information comes from media. Is it possible, then, to use televisual media to teach children about climate change? To answer this question, I conducted research on topics such as the public perception and understanding of climate change, the state of science education, prosocial media, educational media, child behavioral and cognitive development, the shift from broadcast to digital televisual media, and models of environmental children's television. Additionally, I conducted semi-structured interviews with four science educators to better
                understand which science topics are taught in the classroom, how they are best taught, and the role of media in classroom education. And finally, I evaluated the environmental children's television show Plum Landing to assess which environmental topics are deemed developmentally appropriate, the integration of televisual media onto digital platforms, and the need for accompanying hands-on and interactive learning materials. My research suggests that for children to best learn about climate change through televisual media, the program should inspire children to explore in nature, promote positive environmental behaviors, contextualize the issue in ways that are relatable to children, and must include additional hands-on activities that reinforce the concepts.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by deficits in social interaction (e.g., action recognition), and scholars believe that these impairments stem from a combination of differences in bottom-up factors (i.e., sensory representations) and top-down factors (i.e., social experience). The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between autistic traits in nonclinical adults and how these individuals process human actions in terms of static and dynamic features. We measured autistic traits using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and then tested action processing with complex sequences of martial arts and Indian dance actions. On each trial, participants categorized a static or dynamic display by choosing one of two response keys. Initially, the keys mapped onto the two action
                categories depicted in the displays. Then, to investigate the separate contributions of pose and action cues in the discrimination of human actions, the response assignments for the dynamic displays were switched. Individuals with higher degrees of autistic traits learned more about the local pose and action features of the displays, while individuals with fewer autistic traits tended to encode the global action categories. Our results suggest that autistic traits may influence humans' representations of actions as well as their processing of static and dynamic features. Cognitive differences in action processing could have important diagnostic implications for autism spectrum disorder in the future.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.

Unlike profitable transportation companies, such as the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR), the MTA has few valuable real estate assets which could be adequately transformed into transit-oriented and transit-owned joint development hubs. Similar to other U.S. public transportation agencies, space for pragmatic and profitable commercial activities - including shops and offices operating on agency-owned land - is limited to a few select stations, yards, concourses, and passageways, because most profitable assets from private predecessors were sold decades ago. However, while the MTA's ability to remain revenue-positive or self-sufficient through real estate development is stymied, the MTA has been capitalizing upon its few existing assets for additional revenue. This process, however, in coordination with the City of New York in
                order to develop value capture mechanisms, is lengthy and cumbersome. The MTA has not developed the resources needed to develop property. This Senior Honors Thesis elucidates how the MTA can overcome organizational barriers in order to contextually 'transport' the MTA's limited portfolio of assets into 'transformation hubs', and in order to do so, advocate for a privatized, profitable, and independent real estate development division of the MTA, chartered for real estate development. While there is 'room' for improvement, institutional barriers ranging from NIMBYism and a fear of density to antiquated zoning laws, financing requirements, and a lack of communication among the City, State, MTA, and developers would need to be transcended through coordinated reformation efforts. The MTA's collective mindset must be renewed for a 21st century narrative, in which the MTA also considers itself a top tier real estate developer.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tufts University.

First, I briefly outline the history of maroonage as physical revolt and an ideological revolution. Both maroonage and the Black Arts Movement, as the antithesis of western conventions of knowledge, defy commonly conceived notions of time and geographic space. Then, I investigate how, through poetic maroonage, which is similar to Cooper's verbal maroonage/deliberate politics of manipulated language, The Black Arts Movement emphasized and embodied the essentiality of orality and performance in overturning the ideas and institutions of the western, bourgeois, white, male superiority complex. I then explore Carolyn Cooper's notion of erotic maroonage, the idea that what is often misconstrued as vulgarity or
                'slackness' is, in fact, a source of 'subversive freedom in the condition of marginality' (Cooper 1995, 7). I incorporate Ifi Amadiume's complex redefinition of 'matriarchy' in examining how many Black Arts poets employed erotic maroonage to further a grassroots Black nationalism as opposed to a 'respectable' bourgeois Black nationalism. All forms of maroonage are in fact powerful political tools that destabilize the very foundations of neo-colonial systems of white, western domination.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Senior honors thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Tufts University.
