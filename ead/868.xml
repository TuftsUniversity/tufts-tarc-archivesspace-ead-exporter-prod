    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Tufts University was founded as a Universalist institution of higher education in 1852, beginning a long history of student activism. Universalism in the United States has historically had a politically liberal or progressive bent. In the 19th century, Universalists advocated for abolition, the separation of church and state, and the ordination of women.</p><p>Evidence of student activism at Tufts can be traced back to the early 20th century and Jackson College for Women. Jackson College was Tufts University's coordinate college, which was an alternative to coeducational or women's colleges. Women at Jackson College engaged in activist organizing as early as that school's founding in 1910. During World War I, Jackson College students contributed to the Tufts War Garden. These gardens, also known as "victory gardens," were planted at private residences and public parks and were meant to supplement food rations during wartime and boost morale. Jackson College students also advocated for women's suffrage prior to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted some women the right to vote in 1920. Some Jackson students also fought for Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti's release from prison in the 1920s. This highly publicized and controversial case led to the conviction and execution of the two men amidst intense anti-immigrant, anti-Italian, and anti-anarchist sentiments.</p><p>One of the most intense periods of activism at Tufts was from the late 1960s through the early 1970s, reflecting the civil rights, anti-war, women's, gay rights, and environmental movements across the nation.  Tufts s tudents protested the Vietnam War, U.S. involvement in apartheid South Africa, for increased representation of and support for African Americans on campus, and for greater student involvement in the Tufts administration. Opposition to the Vietnam War prompted student protests against military recruitment and against the presence of the ROTC on campus.</p><p>The decades of student activism that began in the 1960s are in large part responsible for the creation of the identity centers—the "Group of Six"—that are now part of the Division of Student Diversity and Inclusion. Advocacy and protests related to the experience of students of African descent at a predominantly white institution led to the creation of the Africana Center in 1969. In 1972, the Women's Center was founded as a student-run and Tufts Community Union Senate funded organization. That same year, the Tufts Gay Community (TGC) organization was formed, which eventually became the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Center. Following an incident in which a campus fraternity had their pledges yell racial slurs outside the Asian-American House, the Start House, in 1982, the Asian-American Center was founded in 1983. The Latino Center, now the Latinx Center, was founded in 1993, amid calls to establish a center comparable to those that supported African-American and Asian-American students. The FIRST Resource Center, which supports first-generation, low-income, and undocumented students, was founded in 2018, building on initiatives led by first-generation students.</p><p>From the 1980s to the present, student activism has continued, focusing on issues including diversity and racial justice, climate change and fossil fuel divestment, labor issues, tuition increases, sexual misconduct and assault, policing and police violence, and protests against the Gulf and Iraq Wars. Students have protested the impact of these issues both on the Tufts campus and beyond. Protests have taken varied forms, including rallies, marches, sit-ins, hunger strikes, die-ins, strikes, and petitions . Many activist student organizations have formed and dissolved over the years, including both university-recognized and funded organizations and organizations that are unofficial or unrecognized by the University.</p>  </bioghist>
