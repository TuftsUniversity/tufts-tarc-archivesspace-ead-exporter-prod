    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The collection was originally processed by Anne Sperber and Ginn Library staff at Fletcher in the 1970s.  No processing documentation has survived.</p>
<p>Five 7" audio reels donated by Casey Murrow in 2011 (accession 2011.090) in containers labeled "Small World Severide," were found to be blank during digitization by George Blood, L.P.  DCA staff double-checked the reels and confirmed that they were blank. The reels were confidentially destroyed.</p>
<p> 	On January 4, 2016 MS025.003.002.16.106.00351: Scripts was found to be not in the box by Rose Oliveira. Previous and subsequent boxes (Box 105 and 107) were checked but the folder was not found. Additional notes in collection documentation folder. </p>
<p>As part of a survey review in 2016,  four boxes (MS025-003-MS025-006) of empty audio reel boxes for "This I Believe" were found in the green barcodes. This note was found in CIDER:  "This item was found uncatalogued in the stacks. Tape boxes are kept as they have symbols we currently cannot identify, fall 2009."  The tape boxes include the following numbers written on the exterior of the boxes: XTV16106, XTV16109-12, XTV16114-19, XTV16155, XTV161159, XTV17168-70, XTV17176, XTV18158, XTV18160, XTV18165, XTV18167, XTV18282, XTV18549, XTV1116097 XTV18560, XT18564, XTV19560, XTV19563-66, XTV19570, XTV19571, XTV20071- XTV20073, XTV20083, XTV20460, XTV20462, XTV20761- XTV20762, XTV20765, XTV21312-13, XTV21522, XTV21525, XTV21529.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of correspondence, personal materials, work files, scripts, diaries, photographs, audiovisual materials, memorabilia, awards, books, clippings, and tributes to Murrow upon his death. Audiovisual materials include phonograph records, and film and audiotape reels of various formats. The bulk of the material dates from 1927 to 1965 and primarily documents the professional life of Edward R. Murrow. Through these materials one can trace major developments in the history of US news broadcasting, and Murrow's work for the Institute of International Education, CBS Europe and CBS USA as well as the United States Information Agency. </p>
<p>Correspondence comprises the bulk of Murrow's papers and includes the entire period of his career from 1930 to 1965. Please note that there is little correspondence for the period when he was Director of the United States Information Agency. Correspondence relates to historical and current issues; deal with key points and broadcasts in his career; cover problems of reporting and public diplomacy, radio and television - their role, their failures, their triumphs; reveal reactions to his work from viewers, celebrities, students, and how he handled criticism of his reporting and his view of his job; general interest items, including anecdotes, humorous letters, exchanges with close friends and well-known personalities; show something about the man, his non-involvement in politics, his concern over lack of public knowledge and interest in world affairs, his despair with television for not taking a stronger lead in educating people. Included are requests for appointments and invitations to speak, requests from charities and from friends for help in finding jobs and asking for personal advice, as well as inquiries pertaining to his programs and special events over the years.</p>
<p>Series 2 is devoted to personal matters - biographical material, family, college, chronological correspondence, awards, publicity, and Murrow's death. Murrow's professional employment, documented in Series 3, covers periods with the Institute of International Education, Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., and the United States Information Agency. Subseries of each organization contain its own correspondence, reports, and related activities. In addition, the CBS subseries  covers administration, program and business operations, correspondents, nine regularly scheduled programs as well as special programs, scripts and sponsors. This series records the history of radio and television broadcasting and as such has tremendous research value. </p>
<p>The collection reveals not only Murrow's demanding radio and television schedule but his extensive extra-curricular involvement with foundations, organizations and clubs; his production of albums, writings for publication, speeches; engagements accepted and engagements declined; and travels.</p>
<p>In addition to the papers, there are approximately 1,600 books shelved in the Murrow Memorial Room at the Fletcher School, along with Murrow memorabilia, mostly in facsimile. The oak table used by the Murrows in their London apartment during World War II, and two large black leather chairs and rug from their Pawling, New York home, can be found in the Murrow Memorial Room.</p>
<p>Tapes, films and phonograph records are stored in the Tufts Digital Collections and Archives at Tisch Library, to be used there by permission of the Murrow Center. CBS News is the donor of "File and Reference" prints of the two McCarthy 16mm films (March 9 and April 6, 1954) and the Murrow obituary film, "An Hour with Ed Murrow," and has agreed to donate additional Murrow films.</p>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Edward R. Murrow (1908-1965) was a prominent CBS broadcaster during the formative years of American radio and television news programs. Stationed in London for CBS Radio from 1937 to 1946, Murrow assembled a group of erudite correspondents who came to be known as the "Murrow Boys" and included one woman, Mary Marvin Breckinridge. Murrow's and their broadcasts from London, Europe, Africa, and Asia before and during World War II set the standard for US foreign news broadcasting. They also helped shape the public's view of a war that Americans were at first reluctant to be drawn into.</p>
<p>Returning to the US in 1946, Murrow became one of the most renowned radio and television news broadcasters of his time. Particularly famous were his programs <emph render="italic">Hear It Now</emph>, <emph render="italic">This I Believe</emph>, <emph render="italic">Person to Person</emph>, <emph render="italic">See It Now</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Years of Crisis</emph>. Of particular note are his 1954 broadcast about Senator Joseph McCarthy's persecution of presumed Communists and his 1960 <emph render="italic">Harvest of Shame</emph> documentary depicting the plight of migrant farm workers in the US. From 1961 to January 1964 he served as the Director of the United States Information Agency (USIA). Murrow died of cancer on April 27, 1965.</p>

McCarthy in 1954.  The correspondence, 1951-58, is arranged alphabetically by year and concerns the production of See It Now and viewers' reactions.  </p>
<p>There are approximately 70 special programs represented in this section.  The programs are arranged chronologically, 1951-58, by date of presentation.  This title and date of each program is provided, as well as an indication of the contents of each file.  An asterisk(*) following the date indicates the file contains just correspondence about the program.  Two asterisks(**) indicates the file contains both correspondence abut he script.  A lack of an asterisk indicates that only the script is available for the program.</p>
<p>The material relating to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy is voluminous.  Included is correspondence and scripts for the Murrow show of March 9, 1954, McCarthy's reply of April 6, and Murrow's subsequent statement of April 6.  There is correspondence arranged alphabetically, congratulating Murrow for his stand on the McCarthy issue, as well as telegrams, and news clippings about the program.  </p>
<p>Filed under the heading, Matter of "M", is a reference file established by CBS researchers as a result of the McCarthy program.  CBS assumed that McCarthy's broadcast of April 6 involved an attack on Murrow and the network with a demand that they should be investigated by a Congressional Committee.  These files were prepared to answer any eventual charges.</p>
<p>There is a large volume of abstracts of information on Murrow and McCarthy which is coded with roman numerals I-III.  Those coded I relate to Murrow, those coded II relate to McCarthy, while those III relate to CBS.  The abstracts, by means of the code system, are related to the original source documents which are also in this section.  These reference files contain correspondence, memoranda, printed matter, news clippings, and several scripts, some for Person to Person. __Research Staff Members: E.C. Perkins, D.H. Rivkin, R.

See "Memorandum" enclosed - "This memorandum is based on the assumption that McCarthy's broadcast on April 6, 1954 involves an attack on Ed Murrow or the networks with the demand that they should be investigated by a Congressional Committee, presumably his own. It is, of course, important to be prepared to identify them as a reprisal at the first available opportunity.  One way this could be done would be to show a pattern of conduct by McCarthy in attacking, as a reprisal, any person who, in the exercise of his independent judgement, dares publicly to disagree with him or criticize him. ---."
