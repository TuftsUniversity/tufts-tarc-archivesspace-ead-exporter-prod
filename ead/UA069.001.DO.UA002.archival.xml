    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Office of the Provost was created in 1951 after the retirement of George S. Miller from his posts of Vice President and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Tufts College.</p><p>After Miller's retirement, Tufts President Leonard Carmichael decided to further divide up the responsibilities of the administration to coincide with the expansion of the college. The position of provost was created to assume the academic administrative duties covered by Miller when he was Vice President. The new provost was expected to oversee the academic affairs of the institution, especially faculty appointments and curriculum problems. The provost also serves as chair of the Academic Council.</p><p>In 1953, after original provost John P. Tilton was elected Senior Vice President, the position was renamed Senior Vice President and Provost. The change in the title added control over not only the academic and financial affairs of the university, but also made the provost the immediate assistant to and stand in for the president.</p><p>Tilton, the first provost, served from 1951 until his untimely death in 1959. A month later, Leonard Mead was named to the post, and served until 1965. Mead was succeeded by Albert Ullman, who held the position until 1973. After Ullman's retirement, Tufts named Kathyrn McCarthy to the position, making her the first female provost. McCarthy resigned in 1979, citing differences with the administration on the direction of the university. After her resignation, the university conducted a nationwide search for a replacement, and in 1981 hired Tufts professor Sol Gittleman, at the time the chair of the Department of German and Russian Languages.  After serving in the position for over 21 years - a tenure believed to be the longest in American higher education at the time - Gittleman stepped down from this post in 2002. He continues to teach and pursue research at Tufts as University Professor.</p><p>Jamshed Bharucha was appointed Provost and Senior Vice President of Tufts University in August of 2002. As of summer 2006,  Provost Bharucha has been active with starting the Summer Scholars program, the Provost's Fellows program and the Graduate Competitiveness Initiative and in increasing faculty recruitment and development, successfully bringing accomplished scholars and leaders as new Deans to Tufts.</p>  </bioghist>

Tilton (1951-59), Leonard C. Mead (1959-65), Albert D. Ullman (1965-73), Kathryn McCarthy (1973-79), Robert B. Shira (1979-81), and Sol Gittleman (1981-2002).</p>
<p>This series contains subject files of the Office of the Provost from the first accession. The original accession of subject file materials for this collection was arranged in one series titled "Subject Files, 1843-82." This included materials from several provost administrations.  When a subsequent accession containing Sol Gittelman records was received in the1980s, a decision was made to create a separate series for each provost.  A second subject file series was created at the time.  However, subsequent accessions indicated that records of different provosts were not maintained separately in the Office of Provost and significant overlap occurred across administrations. As of summer 2006, archivists decided not to create a new series for each provost.  Rather, each new accession will be added to Series 2.  This means that each new run of subject files will be arranged alphabetically, and accessions will most likely overlap chronologically reflecting administrative use.</p>
<p>There is significant overlap in the types of records contained in "Subject Files" (boxes 1-21), "Department Files" (boxes 22-26), and "Correspondence" (boxes 27-30).   The files contain correspondence and reports similar to materials found in other series.</p>
<p>As of July 2006, it was decided to not reprocess these old files but to prevent this kind of overlap in the future.

contains subject files from the Office of the Provost and Senior Vice President. The original accession of subject file materials for this collection was arranged in one series titled "Subject Files, 1843-82." This included materials from several provost administrations.  When a subsequent accession containing Sol Gittelman records was received in the1980s, a decision was made to create a separate series for each provost.  A second subject file series was created at the time.  However, subsequent accessions indicated that records of different provosts were not maintained separately in the Office of Provost and significant overlap occurred across administrations. As of summer 2006, archivists decided not to create a new series for each provost.  Rather, each new accession will be added to Series 2.  This means that each new run of subject files will be arranged alphabetically, and accessions will most likely overlap chronologically reflecting administrative use.</p>
<p>There is significant overlap in the types of records contained in "Subject Files" (boxes 1-21), "Department Files" (boxes 22-26), and "Correspondence" (boxes 27-30).   The files contain correspondence and reports similar to materials found in other series.</p>
<p>As of July 2006, it was decided to not reprocess these old files but to prevent this kind of overlap in the future.   
For reports issued by the Office of the Provost to the President as well as reports from Deans and Chairs to the Provost, see "Annual Reports."  For reports issued by departments to the Office of the Provost, see "Department Records." For reports issued by committees within Tufts to the Office of the Provost, see "Committee files and annual reports."</p></scopecontent><arrangement

departments in Arts &#38; Sciences and the university.  Consists primarily of departmental reports to the provost, but also contains some correspondence.  Each year every department must submit a report to the provost on their activities of the previous year.  These reports may contain budget, program, and hiring information, as well as proposed curriculum, estimates on space allocations, and other program needs.  Some reports are more formal than others. In some cases outside consultants were hired to conduct a study and write the report.  The provost uses this information to make policy decisions.  Often these reports are shared with the Academic Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>There is significant overlap in types of records across previously processed material in "Department Files" (boxes 22-26), "Subject Files" (boxes 1-21) and "Correspondence" (boxes 27-30).   As of July 2006, it was decided to not reprocess these old files but to prevent this kind of overlap in the future. </p></scopecontent><arrangement

contains the correspondence files as designated by the Office of the Provost.  Correspondence from 1956-1962 appear to be missing.  The bulk of the files are from the 1960s and 1970s. Items within files are not in chronological order.</p>
<p>There is significant overlap in types of records across previously processed material in "Department Files" (boxes 22-26), "Subject Files" (boxes 1-21) and "Correspondence" (boxes 27-30).  In addition, boxes 28-30 of the "Correspondence" series were arranged chronologically (although in opposite chronological runs) while box 27 was organized by subject.  As of July 2006, it was decided to not reprocess these old files but to prevent overlap and inconsistent arrangement schemes in the future.</p> </scopecontent><arrangement

correspondence by several standing and ad hoc committees to the Office of the Provost.  Reports generally are informal compilations by individual committees used to produce the annual reports by the Provost to the University President.</p>
<p>Original folder titles only read "Annual reports." This title proved to be misleading as it did not differentiate these records from files in the series "Annual reports" and because folders, in fact, also contain committee related correspondence.  We therefore inserted "Committee files" in the title. Individual committee reports may also be found in the series "Subject Files" (boxes 1-21).</p>
<p>For reports issued by the Office of the Provost to the President as well as reports from Deans and Chairs to the Provost, see "Annual Reports."  For reports issued by departments to the Office of the Provost, see "Department Records."</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f201ab009e97ccf0d44a8c53a07f9ff2"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This
