    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Henry Delfiner was born in 1922 in Vienna, Austria and came to the United States in 1938. After graduating from Amherst College in 1943, he served in the 88th Infantry Division of the United States Army. Delfiner received a PhD from the Tufts Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1962, and later taught at Tufts University in the Experimental College as a professor of International Relations. He developed his own course, called "Understanding International News." Delfiner also taught at Boston University and the University of Wisconsin, and wrote numerous articles and reviews on the political climates of central Europe and the Soviet Union, especially as related to antisemitism. Delfiner died in 2016.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection documents Henry Delfiner's career as a professor and academic. His papers include coursework and his PhD thesis from Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy;  published and unpublished journal articles, reviews, and manuscripts; research notes and bibliographies; and correspondence. His papers also include teaching materials related to courses at the Experimental College at Tufts University, Boston University, and the University of Wisconsin. Teaching materials consist of course approvals, lecture notes, syllabi, student papers and exams, files related to job searches at academic institutions, and a Umatic tape labeled "Tufts Class of May 2 1977." Delfiner's course at the Experimental College, "Understanding International News," was based on current events, so materials for that course contain newsclippings and articles from well-known publications such as the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, largely on topics related to the Middle East and Israel, often appearing with Delfiner's notes.</p>  </scopecontent>
