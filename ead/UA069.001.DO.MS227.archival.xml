    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Julian K. Knipp (1910-1990) was a Tufts University physics professor and chair of the Tufts University Department of Physics. </p><p>Born on January 18, 1910 in Champaign, Illinois to Charles Knipp, a University of Illinois  physics professor, and Frances Knipp, a homemaker, Julian Knause Knipp received a BA with honors in mathematics from the University of Illinois in 1931.  He later attended Harvard University, completing his AM in 1932 and PhD in 1935.   After graduating from Harvard, Knipp taught at Purdue University (1936-1946) and Iowa State College (1946-1955). Additionally, he worked at MIT's Radiation Laboratory (1942-1946) and at the Ames Laboratory of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (1946-1955).  </p><p>Knipp joined the Tufts College physics faculty in 1955 and taught until his retirement in 1975.  During his career at Tufts, he also served as the chair of the Physics Department (1955-1968), Associate Dean of Liberal Arts (1967-1968), and Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences (1968-1969).  Knipp was granted professor emeritus status upon his retirement.  </p><p>Knipp's published research focused on numerous topics, including particle physics and nuclear fission.  One of his better known works is Klystrons and Microwave Triodes (1948), which he co-authored with James Brown Horner Kuper and Donald Russ Hamilton.  </p><p>Knipp received numerous academic accolades throughout his  career. His fellowships and scholarships included University Scholar of Harvard University (1931-1932); Tyndall Fellow (1932-1935); Sheldon Travelling Fellow from Harvard University to Utrecht and Leipzig (1935-1936); University of Wisconsin Alumni Fellow (1937-1938); John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellow, Universitets Institut for Theoretisk Fysisk, Copenhagen (1948-1949); and National Science Foundation Science Faculty Fellow, Rome (1961-1962).  </p><p>Knipp participated in numerous professional organizations, including the American Physical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Organization Committee of the Midwestern Universities Research Association.  He also served on the Board of Editors of MIT's Radiation Laboratory Series. </p><p>In 1987, the physics-astronomy library in Robinson Hall was renamed the Julian K. Knipp Library. </p><p>Knipp was married to Christine Simmons and had three children, Julia, Barbara, and Pauline. He died on December 30, 1990 in Texas. </p>  </bioghist>
