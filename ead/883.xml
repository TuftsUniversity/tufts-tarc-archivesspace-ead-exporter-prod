<p>Clark B. Baldwin (1817 â€“ 1890) served first as Captain of Company E, then as Lieutenant Colonel of Company S, in the 1st Massachusetts Infantry Regiment during the Civil War. Lieutenant Colonel Baldwin was born in December 1817, and was working as a clerk in South Boston, Massachusetts when he enlisted in the Union Army at age 40. Baldwin was in command of the 1st Massachusetts Regiment during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and was wounded during the conflict. In May 1864, he was captured by the Confederate forces at Wilderness, Virginia. Baldwin was held as a prisoner of war at Macon, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, before eventually being exchanged in August 1864. Clark B. Baldwin died on November 10, 1890 and is buried in Melrose, Massachusetts.</p><p>Joseph Henry Barnes (1833 -- 1906) served as Lieutenant Colonel of the 29th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, Company K, during the Civil War. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph H. Barnes was born on July 25, 1833 in Hingham, Massachusetts. He worked as a printer in East Boston, before raising a militia company called the Greenough Guards in 1861. The company was commissioned for federal service in Boston, in May 1861. In December 1861 the company was formally organized as the 29th Massachusetts Infantry, Company K, and Barnes was appointed Lieutenant Colonel. The 29th Massachusetts was a part of the Irish Brigade during the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, and Barnes was in command of the unit during the Sunken Road phase of the conflict. After the war, Barnes remained active in veterans' organizations, and he was appointed as a Deputy Collector of the Port of Boston in March 1874.
