    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains items collected by Tufts University Art History Professor Andrew McClellan for a 2014 exhibition at the Tufts University Gallery on Tufts's mascot, Jumbo the Elephant. McClellan curated this exhibition and wrote an accompanying book entitled Jumbo: Marvel, Myth, and Mascot. Jumbo was born in Africa around 1860, and transported to Paris and London before being sold to P. T. Barnum, who took him to the United States as part of his circus in March of 1882. Jumbo became a national sensation, but in 1885 was killed in a train accident.</p><p>Many of the items in this collection were used in McClellan's exhibition. This collection contains original and copies of photographs, sheet music, posters, newspapers, maps, flyers, and other paper materials related to Jumbo; as well as books, catalogs, programs, glassware, playing cards, a record, and other objects related to Jumbo. </p>  </scopecontent>
