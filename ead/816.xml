    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Center for Adaption Genetics and Drug Resistance was established in 1992 within the Tufts University School of Medicine. Stuart B. Levy served as director from 1992 to 2018. The Center primarily has been an advocate for prudent usage of antibiotics since the 1990s, with its staff members most often appearing in the media to advocate against the overabundance of antibiotics used to treat both patients as well as animals in agriculture.  </p><p>The Center is located on the School of Medicine campus in downtown Boston and most staff are postdoctoral researchers. While employed at the Center, researchers are trained in "techniques and concepts of prokaryotic and eukaryotic biology," in the hopes that they will be able to create new therapies or treatments for infectious diseases and cancer.  </p>  </bioghist>

<p>Processing of this collection was completed by Leah Edelman and Jady Zhang in 2018. Materials were placed in archival boxes if the original housing was damaged, and loose materials were placed in folders where needed. Materials were arranged by record type; received order was maintained where possible. A box-level inventory and series-level description were created, and the finding aid was also created at the time of processing.</p>  </processinfo>
