    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Although a course in Intellectual Philosophy was taught at Tufts since 1856, an actual track for the attainment of a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy did not become available until 1863. The Philosophical Course was originally intended to occupy three years of a student's studies, but in 1866 it was reduced to two years. In 1875 it was increased to four years, where it stands today.</p><p>In 1946, George B. Burch was appointed as chairman of the department. Under Burch the department flourished, and grew to add courses that went beyond the traditional concerns of philosophy and beyond western thought. Unfortunately, by 1966 the department had significantly decreased to only two professors and one instructor. However, student's interest in philosophy only increased over time, and as of 2018, the department employs twenty-two full-time faculty and five part-time faculty and is headed by associate professor Erin Kelly.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Processing of the 2018 accessions was completed by Leah Edelman and Jady Zhang in 2018. Materials were placed in archival boxes if the original housing was damaged, and loose materials were placed in folders where needed. Received order was maintained. A box-level inventory and series-level description were created and the finding aid was updated at the time of processing.</p>  </processinfo>
