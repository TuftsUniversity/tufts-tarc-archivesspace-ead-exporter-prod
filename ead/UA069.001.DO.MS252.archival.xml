    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Marston Stevens Balch (1901-187), served in a variety of roles at Tufts University from 1934-1971 as professor of English, director of Drama, executive director of the Tufts College Theater, chair of the Department of Drama and Speech, and professor of Oratory for the Fletcher School. He resigned from the faculty of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University on May 3, 1971. </p><p>Marston Balch was born in Detroit, Michigan on November 21, 1901. In 1923 he received a degree in English from Kalamazoo College. Balch went on to attend Harvard for a Masters of Arts in 1925 and a Ph.D. in 1931, with both degrees in English with a concentration in dramatic literature and theater history.  </p><p>He began his professional career in 1925 when he started serving as an instructor of English and the theatrical director at Williams College. He also taught in similar fields at Philips Exeter Academy from 1933 to 1934. </p><p>Balch joined Tufts in 1934 as an assistant professor of English. A year later, he also took on the roles of director of the Drama department, the executive director of the Tufts College Theater, and advisor to Tufts Pen, Paint and Pretzels, a student theatre group as well as the oldest student organization at Tufts . In 1940, under Balch's persuasion and effort, Tufts established the first Department of Drama and Speech in New England.  From 1940 until 1966, he served as the chair of the Department of Drama and Speech, professor of Drama, and Professor of Oratory for the Fletcher School. He took leave from Tufts from 1943 â€“ 1946 to serve as chief of the French Press and Radio Analysis Section of the US Information Service, and as chief of Cultural Relations Section under the Department of State during World War II.  Because of his service in World War II, he received multiple honors from France, including the Medaille de la Reconnaissance Francais (Medal of French Gratitude) in 1947  and Legion of Honor Medal from the French Government in 1953 . In 1960, he received the Distinguished Service Awards under in Tufts Alumni Awards Program.  Marston Balch retired from Tufts in 1971.</p><p>Marston Balch married Germaine Cornier in September 1928. Germaine was a French native, and was a professor of French at Tufts University. They had a daughter, Gabrielle. Germaine Cornier passed away in 1969, and Balch was remarried to Roberta R. Blanchard in 1976.  Balch died in 1987.  </p><p>In 1983, the Marston S. Balch Arena Theatre, constructed as a part of the Aidekman Arts Center,  was named in his honor upon the generous donation of one of his former students, Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce. The theater commemorates Balch's 37 years of service at Tufts and provides a unique space for drama productions in the round, a format pioneered by Balch himself. </p>  </bioghist>
