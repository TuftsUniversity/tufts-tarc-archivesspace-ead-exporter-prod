    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Phil Primack (born 1948) earned his bachelor's degree at Tufts University in 1970, where he also served as the Tufts Observer Editor-in-chief in 1969.   He was an Experimental Professor of media law and ethics at Tufts from 2008-2014. </p><p>Philip N. Primack was born on May 1, 1948 to Celia (Piltch) Primack and Joe Primack. He graduated from Haverhill High School in 1966 and received his bachelor's degree in political science from Tufts University in 1970.  Primack was appointed Editor-in-chief of the Tufts Observer in 1969. His tenure there coincided with the November 6, 1969, Tufts student protest, which addressed alleged discriminatory practices conducted by the construction company building Lewis Hall.   </p><p>Primack worked as a reporter at the Mountain Eagle (Whitesburg, KY) from 1970-1974. He published a book, New England Country Fair!, in 1982, and was a reporter for the North Shore: Sunday newspaper from 1983-1985.  He then pursued his master's degree in public administration at Harvard University, graduating in 1987. </p><p>During his career as a journalist Primack covered public policy, politics, and the economy for numerous news outlets, including The New York Times, the Boston Globe, Commonwealth, Boston, and Columbia Journalism Review.  He served as a policy aide to former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II (1997); as a researcher and writer for the New Hampshire Gaming Study Commission (2010); and as a Special Assistant for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (appointed 2015). He has also worked as a consultant for the MIT Sloan School of Management, the Barr Foundation, and Primack Consulting. </p><p>In 2008 Primack returned to Tufts to join the faculty as an Experimental College Professor of media law and ethics, where he remained until 2014. </p>  </bioghist>
