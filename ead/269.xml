    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>This collection was created after finding two wooden artifact boxes in the vault of Ballou Hall in 2010. The artifacts and their labels indicated that they had once belonged to the Tufts War Relics Museum, also known as the Tufts War Museum or Tufts College War Relics Museum, about whose existence DCA had only known through Tufts Weekly articles from 1919-1920. Upon transfer to DCA and further research into the original contents of the collection, WWI posters were moved from the AC collection to this collection.</p>
<p>Most of the original museum artifacts are still missing: according to contemporary articles, the museum included collections sent by Dr. Arthur Irving Andrews (including a section of the barbed wire used in the defenses of the famous fort at Douaumont, shells from Verdum, lead bullets, stones from the Verdun battle field, two horsechestnuts from a tree which though badly scarred was still alive in Verdun), Professor A. C. Lane, Professor H. V. Neal (most likely the Y. M. C. A. material given his service during the war), Dr. W. F. Waytt (including Austrian and Italian helmets, an Austrian trench spade, several bombs, torpedoes, hand-grenades, trench mortar type), by J. C. Geer '18 (pictures of war scenes in Siberia), by Dr. McLean (hand grenade), by W. B. Richardson (four hand grenades) , by E. A. Terhune '17, Talbot, J. B. Kellock '20, Donald MacKenzie '21 of the Tufts Ambulance Unit, and a German Flag and war posters from France and Germany secured through Dean Anthony from Raymond Bon of the Tufts Engineering School. The flag was one which formerly flew over the Kaiser's War College on the Rhine and was taken down at the time of the march of YD, 26th Division, through Engers.</p>
<p>Undergraduate and Alumni and Alumnae organizations of Tufts collaborated in obtaining items for the collection.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>According to a 1920 Tufts Weekly article, Professor Arthur Irving Andrews, head of the Department of History and Public Law, founded the Tufts War Museum in 1919. </p>
<p>The Tufts War Relics Museum, also known as the Tufts War Museum or Tufts College War Relics Museum, was originally and temporarily set up in the library at Ballou Hall with Ms. Hayes acting as custodian and Dr. A. I. Andrews, professor of history and public law, as curator. Tufts students, alumni and alumni and alumnae organizations, and faculty donated items (primarily from Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia) and the US War Department provided military transportation service for shipping items from Europe to Tufts. </p>
<p>In November 1919, a special exhibit of the Tufts War Museum was set up in Ballou Hall (third floor) in connection with the meetings of the Tufts College Teachers' Association and the New England History Association on the Hill. It is currently unknown how long the museum actually existed.</p>

These artifacts were originally part of the collection of the Tufts University Museum of War and most of them are from Germany and France.  The majority of these artifacts are from World War I, and include bronze medallions commemorating battles and events; uniform accessories including buttons, shoulder straps, ribbons, cockades and pins; shrapnel; lighters; and jewelry.  A number of these artifacts still have their original museum labels attached.  These provide colloquial descriptions of the items and their origins.  The artifact cabinet also included a rock collection of unknown relation and origin, which was  included in this series because one of the items was a shard of a stained window of Chartre Cathedral.  Specific descriptions of individual relics can be found in the notes field at the item level.</p><p>Artifacts were kept together and described by cabinet tray.

When found, this drawer had two labels, one states: Matlock Bath 1885, the second states: Hampton Court July 1928.   It is unknown which rocks, if any, these labels correspond to.  These labels have been transcribed and can be found in an envelope in this box.  There were also two labeled boxes in this drawer that likely contain more artifacts relevant to the War Museum collection.  According to their labels, these boxes contained glass from the Verdun Cathedral and pebbles from Capri (1912).  The labels have been transcribed onto acid-free paper and are grouped with the corresponding artifacts.
