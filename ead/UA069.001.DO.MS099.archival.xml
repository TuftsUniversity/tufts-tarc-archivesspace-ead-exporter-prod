<p>This collection was originally part of the archives of the New England Medical Center (NEMC), which closed in 1990. The collection was processed under the leadership of Dave Nathan, archivist at the NEMC archives. from 1985 - 1990, and had the following NEMC acquisition numbers: 83-14, 87-1, 83-3, 84-2, 84-14, 84-30, 84-22, 84-32, 84-39, 85-15, 85-8, 85-11, 85-20, 85-36, 85-12, 85-19, 86-9, 86-14, 86-17, 88-1, 89-10, 89-20, 83-13, 84-36, 84-40, 85-4, 85-7, 85-9, 87-9, 84-9, 84-28, 85-12, 86-39, 86-40, 86-41, 87-26, 88-15, 87-30, 89-5, 89-12, 84-18, 88-1, 84-33, 85-18, 85-47, 85-16, 86-59, 86-60, 86-61, 86-62, 86-56, 84-6, 84-7, 84-30, 84-35, 85-37, 86-4, 85-17, 85-37, 86-64, 86-28, 86-55, 87-36, 88-3, 88-12, 84-41, 86-63, 86-66, 87-8, 83-4, 86-18, 86-32, 86-50, 85-1, 86-24, 84-34, 86-52, 85-34, 86-12, 86-53, 86-33, 87-32, 83-1, 84-9, 84-18, 84-24, 84-32, 84-39, 84-42, 86-23, 86-28, 86-39, 86-40, 86-41, 86-42, 86-55, 86-57, 87-7, 87-11, 87-26, 87-31, 87-36, 89-11.</p>
 
<p>In spring 2013, NEMC material was transferred from NEMC to a restoration company for conservation treatment, and was then transferred to off-site storage in custody of Digital Collections and Archives (DCA). In December 2014 and January 2015, the material was transferred to DCA for processing. Some material originally in the NEMC archives was not transferred to DCA, due to either poor condition or loss.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was processed in from 2013-2016 by Elizabeth Mc Gorty, Project Archivist, under the supervision of Susanne Belovari, Archivist for Reference and Collections; Liz Frances, Records Archivist; and Adrienne Pruitt, Collections Management Archivist.</p>

<p>This collection was previously processed by Dave Nathan. On transfer to DCA, received order was maintained at the series level. Any later additions were placed at the end of series. Photographs and audiovisual materials were separated from their original collections by Dave Nathan, and were given their own series by DCA (MS099.001). Photographs and audiovisual materials were rehoused in archival quality folders and boxes, with the exception of slides and negatives. Some paper-based material was rehoused in archival folders. Collection and series description written by Dave Nathan was updated, but folder level titles were maintained. Not all material listed in Dave Nathan's Guide to the NEMC Archives was transferred to DCA. Missing items have been noted at the series level.</p>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The records of the New England Medical Center (NEMC) contain the administrative, financial, legal, publicity, and departmental records of the institution. The collection also contains extensive audiovisual material; timelines and reference files relating to NEMC's history; publications by and for NEMC; planning files for the expansion of NEMC; and the records of affiliated organizations, such as the Frances Stern Nutrition Center and the Ladies Committee. Of particular interest are the Photographs and audiovisual material series (MS099.001), which contains hundreds of photographs depicting physicians, staff, patients, procedures, and NEMC buildings, dating back to the 1890s, and the Reference material series (MS099.002) which contains historical reference information, including a timeline of events from 1665 to 1992.</p>

<p>As there was a periodic shifting of departments to and from NEMC/T-NEMC and their constituent institutions, any comprehensive search of a particular topic over time must involve also consulting the other NEMC archives collections at DCA. Contact DCA for information about associated material of this collection.</p>

<p>This collection suffered extensive water damage due to a flood before it was in the custody of DCA. It underwent conservation efforts before processing, but several materials, particularly folders, scrapbooks, and bound volumes, are still warped or retain a musty odor. In addition, many items are fragile, and must be handled carefully.</p>

<p>DCA will forward to Tufts Medical Center all requests for permission to reproduce archival materials not in the public domain.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The New England Medical Center (NEMC) is the principal teaching hospital for the Tufts School of Medicine and School of Dental Medicine. The Medical Center's chiefs of service are joint appointees with the medical school and most serve as chairs of their respective departments at the medical school. Students take 25% of their required third year clerkships and 50% of their fourth year electives at NEMC.</p><p>Recognizing that education and research are essential components to good medical care, the New England Medical Center was established in 1930 through the alliance of the Boston Dispensary, the Boston Floating Hospital for Infants and Children, and the Trustees of Tufts College. The NEMC was established as a non-profit corporation to coordinate the administrative activities of its constituent organizations. In 1946 the Joseph H. Pratt Diagnostic Hospital, an extension of the Boston Dispensary established in 1938, joined NEMC. In 1950, when the Medical School and Dental School relocated to Harrison Avenue, the NEMC became known as the New England Medical Center Hospital.</p><p>The entity was renamed Tufts-New England Medical Center in 1968, and in 1970 the NEMC board met at the Coonamessett Inn in Falmouth, Massachusetts to outline ways the NEMC and Tufts could further coordinate operations.  The resulting directives, known as the Coonamessett Statement, indicated that support services and other business functions should be made the responsibility of T-NEMC in each case where it made sense to do so.  That same year Tufts President Hallowell and NEMC President Quarles signed an affiliation agreement that codified the T-NEMC as an alliance through which its constituent units would move toward a completely integrated operation. By 1976, T-NEMC controlled health care studies, medical engineering, community health and ambulatory care, employee-student health services, lab animal medicine, some research, off-site medical services, a common utility supply center, architectural services, communications, educational media, parking facilities, property ownership, and public relations. However, by the late 1970s both institutions had experienced a change in leadership, resulting in a change of priorities for each. Interest in integration waned and the cooperation forged in the early 1970s was dismantled.</p><p>After a period of tension and competition in the 1980s, Tufts and NEMC drafted a new affiliation agreement in 1991, which remains in effect as of 1999. In 2000, the center was once again named Tufts-New England Medical Center, or T-NEMC.</p>  </bioghist>

The files provide a comprehensive overview of NEMC activities and supplement the files found in the series Departments (MS099.004). They cover the records of the President, Executive Vice-Presidents and their staff assistants, medical staff, and the governing boards of various NEMC-related corporations. The series includes memos, correspondence, meeting minutes, and reports. Reports document hospital functions such as laboratory animal medicine, property management, parking, and the planning of the physical expansion of NEMC. Other reports document the Chinese population in Boston, the Chinese Health Center, and personnel. Information about trustees, benefactors, and administrators complete the series. Richard Viguers, Jerome Grossman, and Associate Administrators John Foster and Viola Spinelli are well represented.</p>

<p>For more administration records, please see the Administration records series in the Tufts-New England Medical Center records (MS224.002).</p>

<p>Some files are restricted due to privacy concerns, and this is noted at the folder level.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f9e8bcfabe0246e64544a8c9c70f2b4a"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in 4 sub-series: John Foster files; Viola Spinelli files; General files; and Alan Retik files.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_9a7daff0de949d2e0cf1e83e59940354"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>75 years from the date of creation.

Much of the correspondence and memoranda belong to the directors and administrators of these departments. Of particular note in this series are case files from the department of Social Work Services, and patient logs of the NEMC's emergency room and operating room. Detailed information on patients and their conditions are recorded. Files containing personal information on either employees or patients are restricted.</p>

<p>According to Dave Nathan's Guide to the NEMC Archives, several items in this series are missing, and this is noted at the sub-series level.</p>

the department of Social Services, an office established in 1908 at the Boston Dispensary and later absorbed by the New England Medical Center. Social Work Services provided medical and psychological support for patients' illness related problems and assisted in their transition back into society.</p>  

<p>The early records are primarily those of the Director's office and include annual and special reports, correspondence, and minutes of departmental committees. Financial reports are from the central office as well as the Registrar. Later records include reports on social service, publications, press releases, and news clippings of important individuals. Case files of patients are well represented in this sub-series.</p>

Surgery department. These registers are detailed log books of individual surgeries, and include the patient's name, age, their preoperative diagnosis, the surgery performed, the time it was performed, and the attending surgeons, assistants, and nurses. Records of pediatric procedures from 1931 to 1949 are found in the Dispensary logs for those years. No records of Pratt Clinic procedures from 1938 to 1949 are extant. This sub-series has been restricted because it contains patient information.</p>

<p>According to Dave Nathan's Guide to the NEMC archives, 4 volumes of pediatric logs from the Boston Dispensary and 1 log from the Farnsworth building (Volume 43) are missing.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e137513ba48c3262ef0c7e9d6a26e476"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This sub-series is arranged into two groups, Operating room logs and Recovery room logs.

Interns, residents, and fellows files contain the aforementioned documentation as well as certifications, evaluations, and insurance liability information.</p>

It also includes the personal papers of Frances Stern, the early records of the South End Diet Kitchen, and project files from a study on vegetarian diets in children. Administrative records include reports, meeting minutes, publications, research notes, surveys, articles, newspaper clippings, and forms. The personal papers of Frances Stern are composed mainly of personal correspondence, but also include public speeches, books written by Stern, and memorabilia. The South End Diet Kitchen, founded in 1874, was absorbed into the Boston Dispensary Food Clinic in the 1920s. Its early records include bylaws, reports, financial records, correspondence, and clippings. Case files, notes, and general files  complete the series.</p>

<p>Further information about the South End Diet Kitchen may be found in the Boston Dispensary collection records (MS214). Frances Stern's diploma is located in the Oversized material and artifacts series of this collection (MS099.017). Images of the FSNC, as well as images of Frances Stern, are located in the Photographs and audiovisual material series of this collection (MS099.001).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f156cff7f35db166f10ad0899f5d396c"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged into 4 sub-series: Administrative records; Frances Stern papers; South End Diet Kitchen records; and Study on vegetarian diets in children project files.
