<p>William Johnson Walker was born on March 15, 1789 in Charlestown, Massachusetts, the son of Timothy A. Walker and Abigail Johnson Walker. He was prepared for college at Phillips Academy and attended Harvard University, graduating in 1810. He then commenced studying medicine with Dr. John Brooks of Medford, Massachusetts, and eventually graduated from the Massachusetts Medical College in 1813. </p>

<p>During the War of 1812, Walker practiced medicine in France and studied with French physicians. At the end of the war, he relocated to London and continued his studies for six months before returning to his native Charlestown to open a practice. He would later be appointed physician and surgeon of the Massachusetts State Prison and consulting surgeon to the Massachusetts General Hospital. </p>
