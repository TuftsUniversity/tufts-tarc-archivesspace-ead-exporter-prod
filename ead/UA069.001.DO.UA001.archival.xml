<p>All material accessioned prior to 1997 was originally arranged by subject by Russell Miller. No attempt was made to recreate original order, although material relating to administering the collection was removed to the documentation files of the collection in the archives. Also, some material in the early presidents' records were assembled from other sources when the material was brought into the library in the late 1960s.</p><p>The busts of Hosea Ballou, Alonzo Ames Miner, and Elmer Hewitt Capen, which had been on loan from the Art Gallery, were returned to them on May 7, 2018, by Collections Management Archivist Adrienne Pruitt. </p>  </custodhist>

<p>All material accessioned prior to 1997 was originally arranged by subject by Russell Miller. No attempt was made to recreate original order, although material relating to administering the collection was removed to the documentation files of the collection in the archives.</p><p>Related to series 013, Jean Mayer administrative records and related papers: The 8 boxes originally cataloged as MS 144, Jean Mayer papers were integrated into UA001.013 in March-April 2014 by Dan Bullman, under the supervision of Susanne Belovari (Archivist for Reference and Collections). These boxes are now labeled UA001.013.039-44; unprocessed material: UA001-102, UA001-103). The decision was taken because MS144 in fact contained a mix of Jean Mayer's presidential files, research files and personal records as well as folders related to the newspaper column.  MS144 was dissolved after these files were moved to UA001.013. However in doing so, we did not reorganize or relabel the material because the overall series needs more detailed processing and rearrangement in order to differentiate between Jean Mayer's records as Tufts president and his research and other files. Rusty paperclips and staples were removed at accession. Records in boxes 41 and 42 are water damaged and have indications of non-active mold.</p><p>Digital audio-visual material in the Anthony P. Monaco administrative records and related papers series was processed by Records and Accessioning Archivist, Jane Kelly, in January 2022. Materials were bagged using Bagger and ingested to the Tufts Digital Library. Received order was maintained. A file-level inventory was created, and series and collection-level description were updated at the time of processing. </p><p>Box 30 (barcode 39090010625495) could not be found as of June 19, 2017.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This record group contains the administrative records--including correspondence, financial reocrds, newspaper clippings, photographs, publications, reports, speeches, and subject files--of the presidents of Tufts. Information about all aspects of the college and university are found in the records of the Office of the President. Often this material is in summary form. Records prior to 1976 were inconsistently kept and are even less complete for nineteenth-century presidents.</p><p>Most of the collections of the early presidents contain personal correspondence, teaching material, and writings.</p><p>Materials regarding John P. Marshall (acting president, 1861-1862) are located in his vertical file.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Office of the President is responsible for regulating and overseeing the general administration of the University. Along with various administrative duties, each year the president prepares an annual report which is delivered to the Board of Trustees. This state of the university report generally includes information about past and present college affairs and policies, as well as future plans and suggestions. The Office of the President was the first, and for a time only, administrative office. Originally, the president performed virtually all administrative duties. Presidents usually were members of the faculty as well. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as administrative functions became more complex, the duties of the president were spread among other administrators. With the professionalization of college and university administration in the mid-twentieth century, specialized administrative offices were created, and faculty no longer performed dual roles of educators and administrators.</p>  </bioghist>

Sawyer, as well as some teaching material and some of Ballou's own school books.  Dates range from the early 1820s through Ballou's death in 1861.  Photographs date from 1858 through 1952.  The student records include a recitation (grade) book from about 1854, and records of absences from 1856-61. Teaching material includes notes from lectures on, for example, "The Fall of Rome," "History of the English Language," and "Questions from Bowens Politial Economy."  There is one folder of photographs that were added to the collection at some later point.  These include original and copy photographic prints (dates are assigned based on the original image) of Ballou, his homestead in Vermont, and various memorials to him at Tufts.</p><p>Biographical Note:</p><p>Hosea Ballou (1796-1861) was born in Guilford, Vermont in 1796.  He was a Universalist clergyman, theologian, and historian.  He presided over the parishes of Roxbury and Medford Massachusetts from 1821-1852, published the "Ancient History of Universalism" in 1829, and received an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from, and became an Overseer of, Harvard University in 1845.  Having been one of the biggest influences in the establishment of the College, Hosea Ballou 2d became the first President of Tufts College in 1853.  He was its first professor of History and Intellectual Philosophy.  It would be thirty years after his death before another professor at Tufts was able to match his scholarly and teaching ability in that field.  Hosea Ballou 2d established the college's first curriculum which led to the Bachelor of Arts degree.  He died in office in 1861.  His personal library remains as a legacy to the university to this day.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_d57078b5a217b54b4e446decbff5820d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged alphabetically by subject.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_60174dceb76503726f4dedd7b2404e2d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_6ccd721973290b7c59edf7ffd33deca3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ballou family material</unittitle><unitid>UA001.001.001.00001</unitid><unitdate normal="1855/1873" type="inclusive">1855 -- 1873</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Legal size document box" id="aspace_7740e619c46270d44503c18f5c116420" label="Mixed Materials [39090010621684]" type="box">1</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8539100240f0578d6f3b888ba7285cd5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_2398184ffedf73797ad6cdc3c2d67835" level="file"><did><unittitle>Newspaper clippings</unittitle><unitid>UA001.001.001.00002</unitid><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Legal size document box" id="aspace_84f4ab837c7f0cd11f29b77f7e89089b" label="Mixed Materials [39090010621684]" type="box">1</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b22a6ccf2d7341658efe994e4ef222d6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_eccab4974eef356b759a14ea4e6b1a86" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: T.J.

Organizations covered in this collection include the National Prohibition Alliance and the American Total Abstinence Society.  Photographic prints dated from 1866 to 1939 include original and copy photographic prints (dates are assigned based on the original image) of Miner and his family coat of arms.</p><p>All material accessioned prior to 1997 was arranged by subject, and no attempt was made to recreate original order. Material relating to administering the collection was removed to the documentation files of the collection in the archives.</p><p>Biographical note:</p><p>Alonzo Ames Miner (1814-95) was born in Lempster, NH, on August 17, 1814.  As a young man, Miner taught school in various rural towns in Vermont and New Hampshire.  In 1839 he was ordained a Universalist minister.  In 1848 he succeeded Hosea Ballou (the elder) as pastor of the Second Universalist Church of Boston, a post he held until his death.  Although Miner had little formal education himself, he was firmly devoted to the cause of education in Massachusetts at all levels.  He was at various times a member of the Board of Trustees of Tufts College, the Board of Overseers of Harvard, the Massachusetts State Board of Education and other secular and religious educational institutions.</p><p>Alonzo Miner was involved in many moral and civic organizations.  He was very active in the Temperance movement of the mid-nineteenth century on a local and national level, local work relief committees, national and state peace congresses, and other local civic groups.</p><p>Miner was appointed president of Tufts College in 1862, after the untimely death the previous year of Hosea Ballou, 2d.  According to the terms of the agreement, Miner continued to hold his position at the Second Universalist Church and received no salary for serving as the president of the college.  He is the only president not to live on campus.  Miner brought the college back from the brink of financial ruin, and developed many new educational programs.  He died on June 14, 1895.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_12e09bd0f22352a0af6f9ffa065b5d42"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged alphabetically by

Hooper also received an honorary PhD. in 1898 and an LL.D. in 1915.  He was instructor of Mathematics and Applied Physics at Bromfield Academy and became its principal in 1880.  In 1883 he became assistant professor of physics at Tufts.  In 1890, W.L. Hooper became professor of electrical engineering.  Having been commended by the Trustees for his contributions to the engineering department at Tufts and his successful fundraising abilities, Professor Hooper was made acting president of Tufts in 1912.  He returned to his position in the electrical engineering department in 1914.  In addition to his teaching duties, Professor Hooper continued to write extensively in the field of electrical engineering and worked actively as an electrical consultant for many area companies.  W.L.

He began graduate work at Brown before going on to teach at Olivet College in Michigan.  Bumpus received his Phd. from Clark University in 1891 and then went on to become professor of Comparative Zoology at Brown.  Bumpus received an honorary Doctor of Science from Tufts in 1905 and an honorary LL.D. from Clark in 1909.  He directed the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole and the American Museum of Natural History.  Doctor Bumpus became President of Tufts in 1915, after serving as Business Manager of the University of Wisconsin.  He was the first President that was not a Universalist, and who had been chosen specifically because of his educational and administrative experience.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

Most are formal portraits of Cousens.  Some of the photos were originally in the collection of M.S. Munro.</p><p>John Albert Cousens (1874-1937) was born in Brookline, Massachusetts on November 17, 1874.  He received his A.B. from Tufts College in 1898.  He became the Vice-President of the Metropolitan Coal Company of Boston and a Trustee of the College.  Cousens also served as a member of the Finance and Executive Committees.  He became acting president of Tufts in 1919.  In 1920, J.A. Cousens became president of the college.  Cousens received an LL.D. from Lombard College and St. Lawrence University.  He is credited with having brought the college through the Depression years unharmed.  He was instrumental in the establishment of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and the New England Medical Center.  He died while still in office in 1937.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e4986efaa13c1be372fd6c1d175df42d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged chronologically within each subject.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_c10c07e495195a09a2bee7e493eb0e80"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_bb8283107af11e2b037dc6ded165a38c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photographs</unittitle><unitid>UA001.007.001.00001</unitid><unitdate certainty="approximate" normal="1919/1937" type="inclusive">1919 -- 1937</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container id="aspace_5a1638003fc33cf5fa93c579b1a3caf3" label="Mixed Materials [39090010622575]" type="box">1</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f7942ec7eaf8e26331043f20b5f84058"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_27d10a93b408da49e488c049e2aeeaa0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This folder contains multiple photographs.

collection contains correspondence from 1912-74; clippings; press releases; biographical sketches; publications, including Miller's A Brief History of Medford, published in 1917; photographs; testimonials; and the guestbook from a 1956 dinner honoring Miller.  The correspondence spans Miller's career at Tufts and includes letters to his wife on the occasion of his death. The photographs, the earliest of which date from 1906, are largely undated and include original and copy photographic prints (dates are assigned based on the original image).  Most are formal portraits of Miller.  Some of the photos were originally in the collection of M.S. Munro.</p><p>George Stewart Miller  (1884-1971) was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1884.

Dates are 1920-(1938-52)-74.  The majority of these records were created in the course of Leonard Carmichael's presidency, 1938-52.  The collection contains materials relating to Carmichael's attendance at Tufts, his term as its president, activities at the university during those years, his employment as secretary of the Smithsonian, and his many activities as a professional psychologist.  Significant events represented include Tufts involvement in WWII.  There are no restrictions on access to this collection.</p><p>Leonard Carmichael (1898-1973) was born on November 9, 1898.  He received his B.S. from Tufts in 1920 and his Phd. from Harvard in 1924.  He became a member of the faculty at Brown in 1926.  In 1938, having established himself as a prominent psychologist, Leonard Carmichael became president of Tufts.  During his term as president, the college expanded physically, financially, and in enrollment.  Another major contribution made by President Carmichael was that of time, research, scholarship, and resources made by the college as part of the World War II war effort.  In 1952, after serving as president of Tufts for 14 years, Leonard Carmichael became secretary for the Smithsonian Institution.  In 1964 he left the Smithsonian to become vice-president for research and exploration for National Geographic.  Leonard Carmichael died in 1973.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_c9fb28d8a71c114cb8fa86e3702f4805"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged

id="aspace_91b133b650029412249ebb30283abb7f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series consists of correspondence, articles, speeches, subject files, clippings, and photographs documenting Nils Y. Wessell's many duties at Tufts University, focusing on his presidency (1953-66).  Correspondence dates from 1947-82, though the bulk dates from 1955-66.  Drafts of articles and speeches mainly intended for the Tufts community date from 1940-73.  Subject files cover topics such as Wessell's inaguration and resignation, the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC), Carnegie self-studies, and the many awards and honors bestowed on Wessell.  Clippings document highlights of Wessell's career.  In some instances, correspondence is interfiled with other materials in the subject files.  Black and white photographic prints, created mainly for publicity purposes, show Wessell at work and attending various events throughout his many years of service at Tufts.</p><p>Nils Yngve Wessell (1914- ) was born in Warren, Pennsylvania on April 14, 1914.  He received his B.S. from Lafeyette College in 1934, his M.S. from Brown University in 1935, and his Ph.D. from the University of Rochester in 1938.  He was awarded honorary degrees from Lafeyette College, Lesley College, Boston University, Boston College, Northeastern University, Brown University, and Brandeis University. He was the resident psychologist at the Bradley Home in Providence, Rhode Island from 1936 to 1937.  From 1938 to 1939, he served as the director of the Mobile Child Guidance Center at the University of Michigan.  He was a professor of psychology at Tufts University from 1939 to 1947.  In 1943, he was a lecturer in psychology at Harvard University.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_61f4948659a32983e8588b6b9fcd9527"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged

Mead's career at Tufts University.  Correspondence dates from 1940 to 1974, but focuses on Mead's duties as acting president from 1966 to 1967.  Various materials document Tufts' self-study during Mead's presidency.  Writings and speeches include both published and unpublished works.  Clippings cover all aspects of Mead's career.  Photographs, apparently generated mainly for publicity purposes, show Mead posed and at special events.</p>
<p>Leonard Chapin Mead (1913- ) was born in Milford, Massachusetts on December 28, 1913.  He received an A.B. from Dartmouth College in 1936, a M.A. (1937) and a Ph.D. (1939) from the University of Rochester, and a L.H.D. from Tufts University in 1967.  He held a variety of teaching positions in the Psychology Department at Tufts, starting in 1939, until his retirement in 1976.  From 1953 to 1959 he served as the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.  From 1959 to 1966, he was the senior vice president and provost.  He was acting president from 1966 to 1967, after which he resumed his former duties.  In 1968, he took a leave of absence to serve as the project specialist for the Ford Foundation at the University of Delhi in India.  He returned to Tufts in 1971 and retired in 1979.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_0a87aed6eb02e8f7e0643a1d9a6ae820"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged

He received both a B.A. (1936) and M.A. (1938) from Wesleyan University and his P.H.D. (1949) from Princeton University as well as honorary L.H.D. degrees from Wesleyan University and Boston University (1969), honorary LL. D. degrees from Northeastern University (1973) and American International College (1975), and an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Tufts University (1976). He worked as an assistant professor of economics at Wesleyan from 1941-1942, before working for the United States' Office of Strategic Services in 1942 and the U.S. Army from 1942-1946. From 1946-1950, Hallowell was assistant professor of economics, from 1950-1956 associate professor, and from 1956-1967 Andrews Professor of Economics at Wesleyan. Hallowell served as Wesleyan's Vice President for Planning and Development from 1962-1965, as well as Executive Vice President from 1965-1967.</p><p>He was elected 9th president of Tufts in 1967. In the first year of Hallowell's presidency, Tufts ran a large deficit, and projected further deficits over the next few years.  President Hallowell used his economic background to control expenses and pursue more donations. By the end of his term, the budget was balanced, and Tufts had received an unprecedented amount of donations.</p> 
<p>Hallowell's presidency coincided with a period of social unrest and student activism. Hallowell worked to keep trustees and students thoroughly informed. He gave free rein to student and campus publications. He allowed military recruiting on campus but protested when Selective Service threatened to revoke deferments of students who worked to end the draft. Hallowell established the President's Council for Women and Minorities. In 1973, he appointed a woman as Tufts provost and senior vice president.</p><p>Hallowell also pushed to unite Tufts' disparate schools, colleges, and faculties. He urged that graduate education and research activities should be more integrated with undergraduate programs. Moreover, he strongly believed that education ought to develop all aspects of an individual.</p>
<p>He was a consultant and trustee of various institutions including e.g., Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., the board of governors of the Tufts New England Medical Center, and the Commission of Economic Development, New York City. In addition, he was the first chairman of the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency. Throughout his career Hallowell consulted, wrote articles, and gave speeches on economic topics.</p><p>Hallowell resigned his presidency in 1976. Afterward he served as chairman of Keystone Custodian Funds and a director of 7 corporations. He helped found Friends of the Cape Cod National Seashore and was a trustee of Cape Cod Museum of Natural History. He died Nov. 21, 2006.</p><p>References:</p>

Hallowell during his presidency (1967-1976).  These include addresses given at functions such as Hallowell's inauguration, commencements, conferences, and meetings of associations.  The speeches appear in the form of drafts, transcripts, and reprints and greatly outnumber Hallowell's published works.  Articles include works written for the Boston Globe and Tufts publications on liberal arts education.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_86be63f24b854648e7ec9b302e479ae3"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This subseries is not arranged.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_d1f669fa87a3a059bd9b461f37be7933"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_97f180d6f2be9451f953a5438c6fc1e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles and speeches</unittitle><unitid>UA001.012.002.006.00001</unitid><unitdate normal="1967/1975" type="inclusive">1967 -- 1975</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Half letter size document box" id="aspace_3b04b6bf4d2442fed19f108f21a2871d" label="Mixed Materials [39090010623524]" type="box">6</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d0d115ca6b608476f85481b5470d7a05"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_ee5beb4116b3acbf082d592a2c02d5eb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles and speeches delivered at honors programs and convocations</unittitle><unitid>UA001.012.002.006.00002</unitid><unitdate normal="1967/1974" type="inclusive">1967 -- 1974</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Half letter size document box" id="aspace_bfde97c38b66bca42b755ea7e4eaa2b2" label="Mixed Materials [39090010623524]" type="box">6</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4876d37804dc822027d22aaa0e231805"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_e54c032abf40108811e95afc97226cd7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles and speeches</unittitle><unitid>UA001.012.002.006.00003</unitid><unitdate normal="1967/1976" type="inclusive">1967 -- 1976</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Half letter size document box" id="aspace_c0cf378c912d08166e5ad49565dc5955" label="Mixed Materials [39090010623524]" type="box">6</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_22a1ff6d02715c98827c2d37b21a7b60"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_b58100cac3f10650161ffb7870efddab" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles and matriculation speeches</unittitle><unitid>UA001.012.002.006.00004</unitid><unitdate normal="1967/1975" type="inclusive">1967 -- 1975</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Half letter size document box" id="aspace_d41d2d55d931355b515c01966c52c360" label="Mixed Materials [39090010623524]" type="box">6</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fbd26a87c35680880e6458421d218b82"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_29880284031971fb4460fdb09bade2e3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles and speeches delivered off-campus</unittitle><unitid>UA001.012.002.006.00005</unitid><unitdate normal="1968/1973" type="inclusive">1968 -- 1973</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Half letter size document box" id="aspace_e2f4a5b211109db422a7f880b92c3b44" label="Mixed Materials [39090010623524]" type="box">6</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5c3eadaf380efbf3664a3c433ae3a560"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_ba701fffa774a0590973f7cda6a33fd9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles and commencement speeches</unittitle><unitid>UA001.012.002.006.00006</unitid><unitdate normal="1971/1974" type="inclusive">1971 -- 1974</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial><container altrender="Half letter size document box" id="aspace_34426e684ada4dc16578c020aaf1a55e" label="Mixed Materials [39090010623524]" type="box">6</container></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c04825da6a886df6540f85a186e72031"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c></c><c id="aspace_4ba97a276dca9274334bc057bdc0dad9" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Clippings</unittitle><unitid>UA001.012.003</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">0.25 Linear Feet</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1967/1975" type="inclusive">1967 -- 1975</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9069a8930bb2031c60917f6f9f0f71f1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries consists of newspaper clippings documenting various aspects of Burton C.

<p>The Subject files group contains correspondence, memoranda, reports, clippings, proposals, research, books, photographs, and background materials concerning the diverse subjects of Mayer's career. Also included in this series are articles, addresses, lectures, columns, public letters and related correspondence authored by Mayer in his capacities as nutritionist and university president.</p>
<p>The bulk of the Subject files concern Mayer's presidency of Tufts University, during which Tufts was transformed from a small liberal arts college into a research university with an international reputation. The subjects of these files range from the routine administrative duties of a university president to projects masterminded by Mayer, including the development of the Graduate School of Nutrition, the first in the United States, the School of Veterinary Medicine, first of its kind in New England, the Tufts United States Department of Agriculture Nutrition Research Center on Aging in Boston, and the Center for Environmental Management.</p>
<p>The Subject files also include files concerning local, national, and international organizations and issues of interest to Mayer subsequent to his arrival at Tufts. Local organizations and issues in these files include in part the Children's Hospital of Boston, Boston school desegregation, and the New England Board of Higher Education.</p>
<p>The bulk of the files concerning issues and organizations on the national level pertain to the U.S. Government. These files concern in part Mayer's role in the Presidential Commission on World Hunger (1978-1980), his testimony before congressional committees as an expert on hunger and nutrition, his involvement in the 20th-anniversary commemoration of the 1969 White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health, and his dealings with various facets of the U.S. Government on legislative matters concerning nutrition and funding for education.</p>
<p>Many files in the Subject files concern Mayer's involvement and interest in international organizations and issues. As chairman of the New England Board of Higher Education, Mayer established a scholarship fund for black students from South Africa (1985). As President of Tufts, Mayer developed the Niger Range and Livestock Project and initiated a global classroom project involving Tufts and Moscow State universities (1985). Mayer also created an international association of university presidents, the Talloires University Presidents Group, which addressed issues of arms control, negotiation and conflict management, higher education in apartheid South Africa, and the environment in annual conferences from 1988-1990. As an expert on hunger and nutrition, Mayer studied famine in Sudan, advised the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization of the United Nations, and chaired a task force on children's priorities for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Mayer wrote prolifically and lectured widely on topics ranging from physiological chemistry and human nutrition to U.S. domestic and foreign policy. Included in this series are many of the articles Mayer published between 1972-1992 as well as drafts of these articles and correspondence relating to their publication. Also included in this series are lectures, speeches, and addresses delivered by Mayer on various occasions subsequent to his arrival at Tufts.</p>
<p>Also included are the newspaper column titled Food for Thought and written by Jean Mayer. Some of the columns were co-authored by Joanna Dwyer (1976) and Jeanne Goldberg (ca. 1981).</p>
<p>Mayer's files also include unprocessed materials relating to his father, Andre Mayer.  These include foreign language publications, correspondence, articles, photographs, cassette tapes, a VHS tape, personal calendars, and hoods.</p>

This report, variously called the President's Report, the Annual Report of the President to the Board of Trustees, the President's Annual Report, and The Year in Review, is a summary of all the reports submitted to the president by deans, department heads and administrators. The collection contains the annual reports of the president to the Board of Trustees. The reports of 1919-20 are printed in the Tufts College Graduate, Vol. 18-19.</p><p>This series also contains microfilm copies of these reports.  Some rolls of microfilm were found to contain materials from multiple creating offices.  These rolls are housed in UA193-- University Microfilm Collection.  See this collection and its corresponding  documentation file for more information.</p><p>The president's report is a summary of activities, programs, and accomplishments at the University in the past year. A summary report is published in the Alumni magazine. The complete report generally contains charts, graphs, etc.</p><p>Until 1971, the annual reports of the provost, deans and vice presidents were included in the president's report as appendices. Beginning in 1971 these reports were bound separately from the president's report and are cataloged in a related collection, called Administrator's Annual Reports.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_cc08dc3340c8c3c10b894ce7d2210393"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_4f859835167cbf23da6b738630d38a78"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_2b15ba83e7d0588f0e68d96f96f73ec9" level="file"><did><unittitle>President's Reports F.
