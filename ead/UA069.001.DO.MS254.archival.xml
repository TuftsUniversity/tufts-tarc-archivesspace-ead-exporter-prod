<p>Christopher Joseph Coenen attended Tufts from 1967 to 1971 and graduated  from the Tufts University School of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering with a B.S. degree. Majoring in biology, he was a frequent visitor to Barnum Hall and Jumbo, the stuffed hide of an elephant donated by P. T. Barnum. In 1968, Dr. Russell Carpenter, a professor of biology and curator of Barnum Hall, gave a closing lecture on Barnum and Jumbo to his freshman zoology class. Upon graduation and completing research in the Bahamas the following year, Coenen entered the teaching profession. He taught for 42 years at the Berkshire School and Franklin Academy. Coenen's interest in antique photographs eventually led him to collect material related to Charles Stratton (General Tom Thumb). Coenen retired from teaching and resides in western Massachusetts.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Processing of the 2018 accession was completed by Leah Edelman in 2019. Materials were placed in archival boxes, and loose materials were placed in folders where needed. Materials were arranged in one series with chronological order. A file and item-level inventory and series-level description were created, and the finding aid was also created at the time of processing. Further processing of the 2021 accession was completed by Records and Accessioning Archivist, Jane Kelly, in 2021. Materials were placed in archival boxes, and item-level description was created using a donor-provided inventory. Series-level descriptions were created, and the finding aid was updated at the time of processing. Material from the 2018 accession was integrated into the series created during processing in 2021.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>This finding aid contains language that may be offensive or outdated. Because such language is in direct transcription of materials or donor-supplied metadata, it has not yet been reviewed or changed.

<p>Charles Sherwood Stratton, better known by his stage name "General Tom Thumb," was born January 4, 1838 in Bridgeport, Connecticut to Sherwood Edward Stratton and Cynthia Thompson. Stratton was an average sized baby at birth, but his growth slowed at around six months of age when he was approximately 25 inches tall. He eventually grew to 40 inches tall.</p><p>P. T. Barnum heard of Stratton and contacted his parents. Stratton's parents agreed to allow their four-year-old son to perform and be on display at Barnum's American Museum in New York City in 1842. At the age of five, Stratton was taken on tour across the United States, singing, dancing, and impersonating characters such as Cupid and Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1844, Barnum took Stratton to perform in England and France, including two performances for Queen Victoria. Stratton returned to the United States after the three-year tour and continued to perform for American audiences as part of an exhibit of "human curiosities." </p><p>In 1863, Stratton married Lavinia Warren, who was also a little person who he met while working at Barnum's American Museum. The wedding took place at Grace Episcopal Church in New York City and was widely covered in the media. George Washington Morrison Nutt, known by his stage name "Commodore Nutt," was the best man, and Warren's sister Minnie Warren was a bridesmaid. Approximately 10,000 guests attended the wedding reception. Stratton and Warren were received by President Abraham Lincoln at the White House after their wedding and then traveled to Europe and what is today Bangladesh. </p><p>Stratton continued to perform until 1878. He died of a stroke in Middleboro, Massachusetts on July 15, 1883. He was buried in Mountain Grove Cemetery in Bridgeport, Connecticut. </p>  </bioghist>

<p>Phineas Taylor (P. T.) Barnum (1810 - 1891), was a showman and circus entrepreneur who also served on the board of Trustees of Tufts College and as a benefactor of the institution in its early years.</p><p>Barnum was born in Bethel, Connecticut on July 5, 1810, to Philo F. Barnum, a farmer and shopkeeper, and Irena Taylor. He held many jobs as a youth, including herding cattle, selling theater tickets, and publishing the abolitionist newspaper The Herald of Freedom (1831-1834). Barnum married seamstress Charity Hallett in 1829, and they had four daughters.</p><p>In 1835 Barnum purchased the right to exhibit the elderly enslaved woman Joice Heth, as the supposed 161-year-old nurse of George Washington, at Niblo's Gardens in New York City. He then led a small traveling circus through the South and West, and engaged in a number of unsuccessful business ventures. In 1841 Barnum bought and re-opened the American Museum in New York City. Exhibits included the Feegee [sic] mermaid, the bearded lady, and the "Egress," along with fossils and natural history specimens. Barnum's half-brother Philo introduced him to the dwarf Charles Sherwood Stratton in 1842, and Barnum hired Stratton as an exhibit under the name General Tom Thumb. Barnum and Stratton made several tours to England and Europe (1844, 1858). </p><p>From 1851 to 1857 Barnum was one of the founding trustees of the new Universalist institution, Tufts College (founded in 1852 and opened to students in 1854). After being elected to the Trustees in 1851, Barnum resigned in 1857, because his busy schedule of tours precluded his attendance at board meetings. Between 1882 and 1884, Barnum anonymously gave over $50,000 to Tufts College to build the Barnum Museum of Natural History. He also left over $30,000 in his will to build two subsequent wings. In 1889, Barnum donated the mounted skin of Jumbo the elephant to the Barnum Museum at Tufts.  Barnum hoped that the publicity might be useful to the college, and Jumbo became the school mascot.</p><p>In the 1870s Barnum organized the "Greatest Show on Earth," which traveled by train through the United States and Canada. In 1881 he joined his business rivals to form the Barnum and Bailey Circus. He died in Bridgeport, Connecticut on April 7, 1891.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Lavinia Warren Stratton was born Mercy Lavinia Bump on October 31, 1842 in Middleborough, Massachusetts, to Huldah Pierce Warren and James Sullivan Bump. Lavinia, as well as her sister Minnie, had a form of dwarfism.</p><p>Warren began teaching at the age of 16 and later took a job singing and dancing on a Mississippi showboat owned by a cousin. The program, "The Museum of Living Wonders," billed her as the "Lilliputian Queen." Warren danced, sang show tunes, and occasionally performed a double act with a woman with gigantism, Silvia Hardy, from Maine. In 1862, P. T. Barnum met Warren and invited her to work at the American Museum in New York City.</p><p>In 1863, Warren married Charles Stratton, known as General Tom Thumb, who was also a little person whom she met while working at Barnum's American Museum. The wedding took place at Grace Episcopal Church in New York City and was widely covered in the media. George Washington Morrison Nutt, known by his stage name "Commodore Nutt," was the best man, and Warren's sister Minnie Warren was a bridesmaid. Approximately 10,000 guests attended the wedding reception. Warren and Stratton were received by President Abraham Lincoln at the White House after their wedding and then traveled to Europe and what is today Bangladesh. </p><p>After Stratton's death, Warren married Count Primo Magri. They operated a roadside stand in Middleborough, Massachusetts that featured other little people. Warren appeared alongside Magri in a 1915 silent film, "The Lilliputian's Courtship."</p><p>Warren died on November 25, 1919 and was buried next to Stratton in Mountain Grove Cemetery in Bridgeport, Connecticut.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>George Washington Morrison Nutt, best known by his stage name Commodore Nutt, was born in Manchester, New Hampshire to Major Rodnia Nutt and Maria Nutt. Nutt was a little person who performed in circuses and was hired by P. T. Barnum to appear in the American Museum in New York City. Nutt performed internationally with General Tom Thumb, Lavinia Warren, and Minnie Warren from 1869 to 1872. Upon returning from touring, Nutt ceased working for Barnum. He toured with a comic opera company, organized a variety show on the west coast of the United States, and ran saloons in Oregon and California.</p><p>In 1879, Nutt married Lilian Elston of Redwood City, California. He returned to New York City and died of Bright's disease, a historical classification of kidney disease, in May 1881.</p>  </bioghist>
