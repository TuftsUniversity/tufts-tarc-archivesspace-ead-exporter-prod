<p>The Tufts Daily, founded in 1980, is the daily undergraduate student newspaper for Tufts University. Its mission is to provide a source of news for the Tufts community, a forum for the exchange of ideas, and a means for students to gain experience in journalism. It covers university news, sports, and events as well as some national and international news.  It also includes editorials, a calendar of events, and syndicated comics. Published and distributed free of charge on class days during the academic year, the Tufts Daily is student-run and receives no financial support from Tufts University.</p><p>Particularly valuable are the Tufts Daily photographs documenting campus life - the people, places, events, and activities of Tufts University.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection is processed. </p><p>During processing every effort was made to maintain the original order and file titles kept by the Daily staff.  Where it was impossible to ascertain original order and title, this was noted in the item level description.</p><p>The photographic prints were put into folders. Most negatives were originally housed in binders.  Some negatives were crumpled and damaged due to long term exposure to moisture. Negatives were transferred to archival quality sleeves and stored in drop front boxes so as to flatten the negatives. The slides were re-housed in archival slide boxes.  Random items, such as light bulbs and musical discs, which accompanied the collection, were weeded.</p><p>2018 accessions were processed by Leah Edelman and Alejandra Garcia in 2018. Photographs and negatives were placed in archival boxes and folders. Received order was maintained where possible. Photographs on CD-R were transferred to a stabilization queue for the Digital Archivist. A box-level inventory and series-level description were created and the finding aid was updated at the time of processing.  </p><p>Photographs and production files on CD-Rs were stabilized in 2018 -- 2019 by Rose Koven using Bagger. The extracted files were processed in 2020 -- 2021 by Records and Accessioning Archivist Jane Kelly. Duplicate files and low-resolution copies of photographs were deleted. A file-level inventory was created, and series and collection-level description were updated at the time of processing. Files were copied to Box for access by Jane Kelly and Archives and Research Assistant Cassandra Anderson. Please note that files were not converted for access and all may not be viewable in Box.</p><p>Podcasts and scripts were processed by Records and Accessioning Archivist, Jane Kelly, in May 2021. Materials were bagged using Bagger and ingested to the Tufts Digital Library. A file-level inventory was created, and series and collection-level description were updated at the time of processing.</p>  </processinfo>

Contents</head><p>This series contains negatives produced by the Tufts Daily between 1980 and 2004.  Series may include information sheets for the negatives, contact sheets, and Tufts Daily office documentation.</p>
<p>Negatives are arranged chronologically by semester or academic year. Each folder contains negatives from one binder.  Binders were generally labeled and dated and that information was retained. Undated binders were placed at the end of the series based on apparent dates. When dating individual negative sheets, the date on negative sheet took precedence over binder label.  Descriptive titles [] replaced non-descriptive binder titles, such as "Requisitions" and "Negative to be picked up by", and were added to un-labeled binders.  The original, non-descriptive titles appear in the Notes field.  Subjects include news, events, sports, feature stories, students, faculty, and campus facilities.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

The bulk of the material consists of the production files from a selection of issues from September and December 2004. There are files from each section of the newspaper, including the Arts, Comics, Editorial, Features, News, Sports, Viewpoints, and Wires sections. These files consist of the individual text and image files for articles, as well as PDF and layout files for each page. The remaining material consists of files created by a former photography editor, Justin Golub, and includes guidelines for photography work, meeting notes, and proposals. The predominant file formats in this series include the following, in order of prevalence: Word documents, plain text documents, PDF, TIFF, JPG, and QuarkXPress documents.</p></scopecontent><c
