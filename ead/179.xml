    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Wright Center for Science Education began in 1992 under the full time leadership of director Dr. Eric J. Chaisson. It was primarily funded by the Fondation [sic] H. Dudley Wright of Geneva and the Stratford Foundation. They were located in the Science &amp; Technology Center at Tufts.</p>
<p>Its goals were to improve the teaching of science in secondary schools, to encourage young people to pursue science as a career, to explore innovative methods to communicate new and better ways of teaching science, and to test and disseminate novel educational practices. In order to do so, it operated a number of programs including sponsoring fellowships, seminars, workshops, public lectures at the Boston Museum of Science, and creating educational products designed to aid secondary school science teachers.</p>
<p>The fellowship program searched for national and international "master-teachers." These "master-teachers" were secondary-school science teachers who had developed "innovative instructional methods and science/math curricula" to give them a one year sabbatical at Tufts. Wright Fellows developed curricula, organized the workshops, and built educational products to provide to other science teachers to further the Center's goals.</p>
<p>In November, 2007, the fellowships were suspended due to lack of funds. The Wright Center ceased association with Tufts University after May, 2011.</p>  </bioghist>
