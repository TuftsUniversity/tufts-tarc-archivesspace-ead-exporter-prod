Grade sheets were used to record the final grades for all students in a course.  Early years include letters and memoranda changing grades, often as a result of completion of work for the semester, where the instructor was reporting a grade to replace an "incomplete." After the mid-1950s, the number of "completion" forms declines. After this point, most forms reporting grades to replace an incomplete were filed separately from the grade sheets; these separately-filed forms are found in series 2: Grade changes.</p>
<p>Grade reports for the fall and spring semesters from 1980 to 1987 are absent, though the reports for summer sessions in these years are present.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_0e99b41ff3cc718c268c5b91ea4d58c7"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged chronologically, by semester, with courses arranged alphabetically by department and then course number within each semester.
