    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy was established in 1933 by a bequest from Austin Barclay Fletcher, late president of the Board of Trustees and lifetime benefactor of Tufts. Fletcher's gift of $1,000,000 was intended to finance a school of law and diplomacy, but it was nearly ten years after his death before the Fletcher School opened its doors. When it did so, in the midst of the Great Depression and with the collaboration of Harvard University, the Fletcher School became the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States.</p>
<p>As envisioned by Fletcher and President Cousens, the Fletcher School was to have occupied a new building on the Medford Campus, situated next to Miner Hall. However, as the financial uncertainties brought on by the Depression increased, it was decided to open the school in the old Goddard Gymnasium instead, with the understanding that dramatic renovations would be made to make the building habitable. Classroom and office space was provided in the building, but the focus of the renovations was to provide a home for the school's library. In 1964, Mugar Hall was built adjacent to Goddard Hall to provide additional office space and dining facilities for Fletcher students. In 1981 the Cabot Intercultural Center was added to the complex, linking Goddard and Mugar Halls. The Cabot Center provided a large auditorium and seven floors of offices for faculty and administrators of the school.</p>
<p>The library of the Fletcher School was one of the thorniest problems presented to the school's founders. The books, serials, and other publications deemed necessary to support the curriculum of a school such as Fletcher were absent from the college library and to acquire them would have constituted a major expense at a time when finances were extraordinarily tight. Problems over how to manage the library contributed to the delayed opening of the school. After several years of discussions and negotiations, a solution was presented in 1933 when the World Peace Foundation, at the prompting of Fletcher's Acting Dean Hoskins and thanks to groundwork laid by President Cousens, offered to donate its library of 40,000 volumes to the institution to form the basis for a suitable collection. In subsequent years the Foundation maintained many of the periodical subscriptions essential to the collection.</p>
<p>Harvard's involvement with the Fletcher School began in the planning stages, when Tufts President John Cousens opened discussions with several individuals at Harvard in 1930 concerning the proposed school. Roscoe Pound, dean of the Harvard Law School, was sufficiently intrigued by the possibilities to bring the plan to the attention of the president of Harvard. Cooperation between Harvard and Tufts in the development of Fletcher was seen to bring assets to both institutions, and in 1932, a plan was developed by which Tufts and Harvard would manage Fletcher. According to this agreement, a Joint Executive Committee was formed with members from Tufts and Harvard, and professors were to be chosen from the faculties of both institutions. The deanship of the Fletcher School was to be held by Tufts and the school was to be located on the Medford Campus. This agreement ultimately served as the basis on which the Fletcher School was built. However, within a short time the agreement was under discussion again as Harvard registered objections to the manner in which administration of the school had evolved. A revised agreement signed in 1934 reworked the participation of Harvard in the administration of the school and was the foundation for the duration of Harvard's involvement with Fletcher. As a result of this agreement, Fletcher was officially known as "The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, administered by Tufts College, with the cooperation of Harvard University."</p>
<p>While initially conceived to offer a Ph. D. degree in addition to a masters degree, it was quickly apparent that the new school would not be able to offer the resources necessary to support such a program. Instead, students were offered the choice of obtaining either a Master of Arts degree after one year of study or the specially designed Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy (MALD) after two years of study and successful completion of a thesis and examination by the faculty. Students chose to concentrate in either Public and International Law, Diplomacy and International Relations, or International Economics. The focus was to be on preparing students for foreign service or international business, and to that end, the school sought to build a small student body of exceptionally qualified students. Twenty-one students entered Fletcher in October 1933, all with bachelor's degrees and four already holding a master's. They were expected to have reading knowledge of French or German - if not both - and a thorough grounding in history, government, and economics.</p>
<p>Faculty staffing was an ongoing issue in the early years of the school. As initially conceived, Fletcher was to have a full-time resident faculty supplemented by adjuncts from Tufts and Harvard. However, it initially proved to be a difficult task to attract faculty of sufficient caliber at the salaries that Fletcher was able to offer. The first full-time faculty member, Dr. Norman J. Padelford, professor of International Law and Organization, was not appointed until 1936-37.</p>
<p>Housing for Fletcher students was acquired in 1936 with the purchase of Wilson House on Winthrop Street. In 1939 Blakeslee House, on Curtis Street, was added to house women students at Fletcher. Both houses were named for original members of the Fletcher faculty. In the early 1960s Fletcher was given Fletcher Hall to use as a dormitory for its students, and Wilson House and Blakeslee House were returned to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>After World War II, Fletcher instituted specialized training programs for career diplomats in other countries. The first such program was in 1949, for the diplomatic corps of newly independent Pakistan. Since then, programs have been run for groups from Kuwait, Qatar, and others.</p>
<p>When student protests against the United States' involvement in Vietnam and the presence of ROTC and in-service training officers on campus and particularly the Fletcher School reached a peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Fletcher became the focus of student anger. Dean Guillon of the Fletcher School was an outspoken supporter of the US role in Vietnam and the presence of military personnel on campus, prompting student outrage. In 1970 students firebombed Dean Guillon's office in Mugar Hall, causing an estimated $70,000 in damage. </p>
<p>In 1973-74 a combined degree program with the was instituted in which highly qualified undergraduates would be admitted at the end of the Junior year to work toward both the B.A. and the Fletcher M.A. Because Fletcher's student body has traditionally been made up of students with experience in the field, either in diplomatic service or international business, as well as grounding in multiple foreign languages, very few undergraduates have been admitted to the program.</p>	
<p>In 2005, Fletcher enrolled an average of 350 students per year, from the United States and more than seventy countries around the world. Students choose from fields of study including Public International Law, International Organizations, International Business and Economic Law, Law and Development, United States, Europe, Asia, Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization, International Information and Communication, International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution, International Trade and Commercial Policies, International Monetary Theory and Policy, Development Economics, International Environment and Resource Policy, International Technology Policy and Management, Political Systems and Theories, International Security Studies, Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis, International Political Economy, and International Business Relations.</p>

<p>In October of 2019, Rachel Kyte was appointed as dean, the first woman to hold this position. Kyte graduated from the Fletcher Global Master of Arts Program in 2002 and served as a professor in the school from 2014 to 2019.</p> 

<p>As of 2020, the average number of students enrolled has increased to an average of 550 students each year from over 41 countries around the world. In November of 2020, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy announced it would begin offering a new Master in Global Affairs program in September 2021. This change was implemented to prepare students to become leaders in Fletcher's preexisting disciplines as well as in global warming, cybersecurity, and other large global issues.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>For Series 9:This material was received from the Fletcher School in 2005 as part of a continuation of their Board of Overseer Records, which is a series in the Fletcher School records.  This material was placed in UA181 as a new collection when it was first received.  While checking on some background information about Fletcher, Laura Cutter, Archival Assistant, discovered there was already a series in UA015 for the records of the Fletcher Board.  It was agreed that this material should be moved into UA015 and the records in UA181 were deleted when processing was complete.</p>
<p>The material consistently referred to both the "Board of Overseers" and the "Board of Visitors."  Before processing began, the Fletcher School confirmed that the Board of Overseers was, in fact, part of the records of the Board of Visitors.  Around 1996/97, Fletcher began using the term "Overseers" instead of "Visitors."  It was determined that the two sections of material (regarding "Visitors" and regarding "Overseers") in the boxes were part of a continuous set of records.</p>
<p>The content of the new additions to this collection were determined to be primarily files relating to the annual meetings held by the Board of Overseers (formerly Board of Visitors), 2-3 times per year.  A small percentage of the material involved Board development and correspondence.  Also included a few written histories of the Fletcher School's Board, based primarily upon Russell Miller's books.  Except a grouping of historical documents and meeting minutes, no obvious order was visible.</p>
<p>The decision was made to standardize the folder names for those files that contain meeting material.  Many were simply dated with the month and year.  The previous set of records received (from 1950-80) were standardized and labeled as meeting materials.  Those folders were then filed alphabetically with the other folders in the collection.  That process was duplicated with these records.  The meeting records are alphabetical within all the records, and are chronological within themselves. Whenever possible, the original names were kept for the non-meeting folders.  The alphabetical style was kept in anticipation of future records from the Board of Overseers.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1997 (with the name change to "Overseer") the Board began presenting their meeting materials in binders, rather than folders.  The material from 1997-2005 was all in binders.  It was decided that for preservation purposes, the materials should be removed from the binders and transferred to folders, even though it somewhat destroyed the original format.  In order to indicate the original placement of materials, the folders were all given standardized labeling which indicates how the material was arranged.  Since future materials will probably be sent in binders, these standards can be used for them as well.</p>

Most of the material dates between the 1920s and the 1960s, although some information from the 1980s is included. Correspondence accounts for the majority of the material. Materials include President Cousens' correspondence regarding the evolution of the school in the 1920s, and correspondence from Dean Hoskins, President Carmichael, and Vice President/Provost Mead. This series also includes files on special programs, such as the Latin American Teaching Fellowships, proposed curricular changes, "centers" within the school such as the Murrow Center, and special events. This series includes brochures and clippings.

Abstract:  All across the globe women are assuming roles that were previously reserved for their male counterparts  be it at the lowest or highest echelon of political power. Unlike the rest of the world, the Middle East and Muslim world have been slow to come to terms with this changing reality, but they too are gradually succumbing to the changing culture of increased women s participation in politics. Various countries in different continents have benefited from the increased participation of women in politics and it may be argued that similar successes could also be replicated in the political arena of this part of the world. Lebanon, as an illustration, presents a mid-way position in the region in that it is more liberal and has a more advanced civil society, but women are yet to seriously penetrate politics. In the larger context of low women s political participation globally, the Middle East suffers from even lower penetration of women in politics. As a medium towards development and international integration, women present a somewhat untapped resource in the social, economic and political arenas in the region, and this study aims to provide information and recommendations to show opportunities for increasing their political participation, particularly at the parliamentary level of government. If the acknowledged political accomplishments of women in other countries are anything to go by, particularly post-conflict societies, the increased involvement of women in Middle East politics will benefit the region through better governance that would permeate other aspects of society. Thus, the argument being made here that women s political participation in the Middle East and Muslim countries cannot be achieved without the reassessment and implementation of the specified recommendations  revising education, establishing quota systems and institutionalizing regional reform.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8890d643db0a9af4402776e07389e05d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_afb23438cdbe226ef5bfb58bf29983e4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Multiple Use Services: Meeting the Productive and Domestic Water Needs of the Rural Poor</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bingham, Rachel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_89c9695511ba3c3f3e81e7fcfa658772">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  This report uses a detailed 55 household survey in the village of Thidé (pop. 1800) in the southern part of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania to answer the following three questions: Does the net impact of productive water strengthen rural livelihoods and reduce poverty of rural households? If so, to what extent do productive uses of water form an important contribution to these livelihoods? Does it provide opportunities for asset accumulation? Although the realization that the poor and water scarce distribute their water consumption across multiple activities is not a new, attempting to account for these various uses is. The debate regarding the benefits and costs to livelihoods from productive water is currently raging. Estimating these incremental benefits and costs will help governments and non-governmental organizations value water systems appropriately, and can also inform the design of community water systems. Above all, if the balance of costs and benefits at the household level is known it will determine if multiple-use water services (MUS) are truly a superior approach to water resources development. This household level analysis provides an explicit example of how the availability of productive water strengthens rural livelihoods and provides opportunities for asset accumulation in the form of livestock, trees, and revenue from livestock products.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0e08b0deec94faf4e9b2e39277fa8b95"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">International Environment and Resource Policy</subject><subject source="local">International Organizations</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4a9174bf9b7b28a8f84fd6c0e9a13944" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Strategy for the Long War: The Key Components of Counterinsurgency fro Malaya and the Philippines</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bjorklund, Eric R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_21b1c71c3354f3ab8108ed15e3b65de7">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  This paper examines the counterinsurgency strategies implemented by the British during the Malayan emergency from 1948-1960 and the Philippine's during the Hukbalahap Rebellion from 1946-1954 in order to determine a set of key components that compromise successful counterinsurgency strategy. The purpose of the paper is to inform policymakers and military leaders of the complexities of counterinsurgency, yet provide a framework for developing a robust counterinsurgency strategy that transcends time and geographic location. Given the increased threat from asymmetric, irregular enemies, this paper is an attempt to better prepare the U.S. for these relevant, dangerous threats.  This examination is developed in three parts. First, in order to develope a framework for defeating insurgency, an understanding of insurgency strategy is necessary. Second, historic counterinsurgency doctrine is analyzed in order to determine the most essential components of successful strategy. In this section, four key components of counterinsurgency are developed. First, the population must always be defined as the center of gravity. Second, dynamic leadership is a critical element. Third, a government must defedine its national and military strategy to counter the asymmetric threat. Fourth, a government must be capable of altering the structure of its military forces away from conventional war models. The final selection utilizes case study methodology to analyze the two successful counterinsurgency operations based on the key components developed earlier in the paper.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_340a416eb20e80e2664d19bbbf94a416"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0a591427fe74a4cc84b3281105073d78" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards a New Model of Cooperative Development: Enhancing and Leveraging the Benefits of FDI for Emerging Economies</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ciesluk, Sylvia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8da9a3ee03c0dca5469059611fa3c0a8">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  Over the past 25 years, economists and national leaders have shifted their views on development in a significant way. From the first development model which rejected foreign capital and relied on direct state control, to an abrupt change to a second model that hailed liberalization and private enterprise as the keys to achieving economic prosperity and rising living standards. Along with the liberalization of state controls on economic activity and international trade, foreign direct investment (FDI) was now hailed as the best medicine for a backward economy. However, just as the first model fell into disfavor, uncertainty over the second model is rising. This result can to a large degree be explained by the situation today in which developing countries are attracting an increasing amount of FDI year aft! er year, yet there is a sense that many are failing to realize the expected development benefits of foreign capital inflow. The paper explores how the current views toward foreign investment and development are changing. Part I sets the stage by exploring the history of attitudes toward FDI with respect to development. This section describes how and why foreign investment has rapidly increased in the developing world. It also surveys the current debate over the potential of FDI to contribute to development and the opposing view that most of these contributions go unrealized. Scholars and practitioners offer a number of reasons and theories why this later outcome may be so. The hypothesis set out at the outset of this study establishes that the reason expected spillovers to a developing host economy may not occur is partly due to a low level of absorptive capacity in the host country but also largely hinged on the quality level of the investment. This hypothesis is tested in the final part of this section with a case study of FDI and its impacts on human capital development in Kazakhstan. Part! II begins a search for solutions to this problem of how to ensure that FDI will create development benefits. Investors into foreign markets have always followed a simple formula, maximize return and minimize risk. Here, I explore the options available to host countries to follow a similar formula, maximize return to their country and minimize the negative risks of FDI as well as the role of international institutions, home governments and foreign investors.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a00e5e9f9aae11fe695b177368a636a6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">International Business and Economic Law</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commercial Policies</subject><subject source="local">Law and Development</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e8d4a1adfdd988c39c18f3001ced7739" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Market for Microfinance in Brazil: An Industry Analysis</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Deucher, Gioia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a7105943b8800172de95d4932d68c0b1">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  This MALD Thesis provides an overview of the market for microfinance in Brazil based on a review of the existing literature and findings from primary research on the ground. Even though it is the birthplace of modern microcredit, Brazil today has an underdeveloped microfinance sector, with demand being largely unmet by supply. This thesis looks at the root causes of the phenomenon as commonly cited in related literature, and tests the arguments against findings from primary research. The Brazilian economic context of high interest rates and heavy taxation exacerbates the problem of informality and related limited access to credit, and the micro-enterprise sector is a primary source of employment in the country. This would suggest that Brazil is an attractive country for MFIs. However, there are only a handful of MFIs that have reached scale. The strong presence of the state through social assistance programs and the abundance of consumer credit are often cited as the main reasons why the sector has not really taken off in Brazil. This thesis provides a detailed breakdown of supply of and demand for micro-financial services, and tests the findings against primary research conducted in three rural cities in Brazil's state of Goias. Recommendations are made on how to best promote the microfinance sector in Brazil, given the competition from consumer credit agencies and government subsidized credit lines.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3e0874a081094b79c876e4da802dba29"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_71c8bde0186e2374e40ac1885be4e42d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Investing in A Newly Deregulated Energy Sector - The Case of Kosova</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kaganiku, Teuta</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_68e1d705c4dc867bf6f35e285e714106">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  Eight years after the end of the conflict, Kosova's economy is still lagging behind. With a slow annual growth rate of 3 percent, the unemployment rates of a two million nation are still high reaching at times up to 50 per cent of the employable population. The 1,117 GDP per capita in 2006 was slightly less than in 2005 when it stood at 1,120, and the national income still depends around 69 per cent on customs tax. Kosova is not demonstrating yet a sound economic performance in order to provide its citizens with qualitative services and opportunities for a poverty-free living. The domestic production is very slowly reviving mainly through the privatization of publicly- and socially-owned enterprises of the pre-war centralized system. There is a small number of new production businesses being established, but they are small or medium in size. Kosova is not poor in natural resources. Mines of zinc and lead oars, nickel and iron, and lignite were the country s primary sources of foreign exchange. At present, their production is hardly a small portion of what was produced in the times when the companies were at their peaks. In the last years, much of the economic growth discussion evolved around investments in the energy sector and the construction of a new power plant, which should generate lignite-based energy not only for Kosova, but for the region as well. With a GDP of 2.2 billion Euros, the Kosovar government cannot afford to construct a plant with a cost estimated at 3bill USD. Still lacking statehood, Kosova cannot apply for international loans. Expecting to inherit the debt that the Serbian government has taken up on behalf of Kosova, estimated at 1 bill USD, the ability to borrow internationally is postponed even further to a distant future. The only option left is foreign investment. The question unanswered is how these investments will boost Kosova s economic growth, while ensuring benefits to the foreign investor.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f56212a25e136507f4d1e0dd2c8f7c77"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commercial Policies</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e9a9fdb488d589413031eb9b703caf53" level="item"><did><unittitle>An Examination and Analysis of the Interests Behind United States Political Support of Israel</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lupesko-Persky, Osnat</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_58441f26134638ecc700551cc95662ba">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract:  This study was funded by the International Food Policy Research Institute through the USAID university linkage program and looked at mortality, morbidity and malnutrition rates in the Darfur conflict and how they were affected by the humanitarian intervention from 2003 through 2005. It also looked at how the intensity and type of humanitarian intervention affected vulnerability among displaced and affected residents as well as the various ways that relief services could have been made more effective in reducing vulnerability to food insecurity. Although the mortality, morbidity and malnutrition surveys were not directly comparable due to differences size, they nevertheless offered an important understanding of the impact of the humanitarian intervention. It was found that global acute malnutrition rates mostly remained high and above emergency thresholds, but severe acute malnutrition rates remained mostly below the emergency threshold, which could have been due to deaths of the most vulnerable children or amelioration of their health (into the global acute malnutrition category or above) attributable to the humanitarian assistance. Abu Shouk camp was studied to showcase the cyclical nature of malnutrition and mortality among children under five in Darfur. During the hunger periods in 2004 and 2005, the camp experienced remarkably high global acute malnutrition and under-five mortality rates, both of which  significantly  improved after the harvesting season. This was also consistent with the explanation that severely malnourished children either died during the hunger period or the health of surviving children was improved by both the humanitarian assistance and/or increased access to food during the harvesting season. The study found evidence to suggest that the humanitarian assistance intervention was effective in decreasing malnutrition and mortality rates in Darfur once it got under way in February 2004 as there was a general reduction of global acute malnutrition, severe acute malnutrition, crude mortality rates and under-five mortality rates.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_644744e49a965546ab8b2a91505b17fb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5f7b860c198e93a241a143823965303d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Time to Restructure the Ukrainian National Association: Here's Why and How</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Olesnycky, Damian</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_656cdb38417ceea3407bf1c5a031f116">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  The Ukrainian National Association (UNA) is a Ukrainian-American fraternal benefit society based in Parsippany, New Jersey. Founded in 1894 to help poor Ukrainian immigrants pay for funerals and support ailing family members, its mission is to preserve Ukrainian culture in North America and to provide its members with financial products and services, primarily in the form of life and disability insurance. During its first century of existence, the organization amassed a sizable membership base and a considerable amount of wealth by catering to three large waves of Ukrainian immigrants. The UNA harnessed its resources adeptly, founding numerous cultural institutions (referenced in this report as  fraternal activities ) and becoming a powerful advocate for Ukrainians worldwide. As a result, the association played a central role in the formation of the Ukrainian-American and Ukrainian-Canadian identities. The past decade, however, has been a difficult stretch for the UNA. The insurance business, the association s longtime economic motor, has been unprofitable since 2002 and has turned a loss for 8 of the last 12 years. Sales have fallen dramatically from mid-1990s levels and the business has been severely weighed down by its sponsorship of fraternal activities, which have generally cost about $1 million per year to sustain. This has prompted an alarming reduction in the UNA s overall wealth, forcing the association to liquidate real estate assets to keep itself afloat. Reviving the insurance business would require a substantial and sustained boost in sales. But such a turnaround is unlikely  the association s insurance products compete directly with the lower-priced, well-marketed offerings of large commercial insurance companies. This competitive disadvantage, faced by most other fraternal benefit societies, is a structural one about which there is very little management can do. In this report, I forecast how long the UNA can survive in its current form as well as how long it could live under several alternative organizational structures. I estimate that, if nothing changes (the insurance business continues to be the sponsor and administrator of fraternal activities), the insurance business only has enough capital to survive for another five to thirteen years and that the fraternal activities can be sustained until 2022 at the longest. Further, if the UNA is unable to sell property it owns in Jersey City, New Jersey by 2010, the insurance business and the fraternal activities will both die the following year. My recommendation for the future course of the UNA is to sell the insurance portfolio and to restructure into a cultural endowment dedicated to promoting and preserving the fraternal activities. I hold this opinion for three reasons. Firstly, according to my survivability estimates, the fraternal activities would live longest if the association were structured as an endowment. Such a restructuring would bring no hardship to owners of UNA insurance  their policies would merely be administered by a different (and probably a financially healthier) party at no additional cost. Secondly, with UNA management focused on the fraternal activities and no longer busy trying to turn around a structurally uncompetitive insurance business, the performance of the fraternal activities would likely improve substantially. Thirdly, many Ukrainian-Americans make financial contributions to the UNA for the sake of preserving the fraternal activities. An endowment would not only be the most efficient and productive vehicle for these funds  it would also the only one that, with enough support, would make it possible for the fraternal activities to live forever.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_39851cd710785773a1f25656d3246ddd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1dcc933dea6fe57eb31be54b0590d6a5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Energy Relations Amongst the United States, the European Union and the People's Republic of China: A Strategic Triangle or Three Sides without a Triangle?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Palti, Leslie</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fa1ce96a1a24af46872630891d13a878">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  As the three world's biggest energy consumers and importers, the United States, the European Union and the People s Republic of China will determine energy relations in the years to come. China s energy diplomacy is increasingly a matter of concern for the transatlantic community. The energy security debate surrounding China is part of a broader debate concerning China s future role in the world. Energy security is high on the agenda of the world s major petroleum consumers. In addition, acknowledging that their imports are rising (by 2030 the US, the EU and China will import almost two-thirds of their energy needs) and that transnational imports are coming from fewer places in the world, the perception and presence of geopolitical competition is increasing. In this respect, Chinese energy diplomacy has political implications beyond the energy game that are at cross-purposes with European and American interests in various parts of the globe. It is crucial that the US and EU take into account the increasingly assertive China in their dialogue concerning transatlantic energy as the world s energy map is redrawn.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c092867ca6028b69a790363896e2ef1a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Environment and Resource Policy</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Pacific Asia</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e9e7d6129f16e163322519fc7effac2c" level="item"><did><unittitle>In Pursuit of the Triple Bottom Line: Economic, Social, and Environmental Commitment at Clif Bar, Stonyfield Farm, and Starbucks</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rainey, Kristen M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_54e74d8dc08a9ff2374e5c8b50cfe9a1">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract:  All countries need an extensive and reliable road infrastructure network in order to promote economic growth and enhance their security. Like in most countries, US transportation budgets are constrained while traffic bottlenecks are increasing and roads  quality is on the decline. This results in growing infrastructure funding gaps and a pressing need to find alternative funding mechanisms to taxes and traditional bond financing. The century-old model of Public-Private Partnership has recently reemerged in the context of rising involvement of the private sector in the provision of public services. PPPs are contractual agreements between a public and a private entity and typically provide significant and flexible financing. In addition, the expertise of the private sector will lead infrastructure assets to be more efficiently operated and bring in more revenues than under public provision. In comparison to France, the United States offers a more favorable ground to the implementation of PPPs. Indeed the private sector has traditionally been involved in the US economy and a federal system presents certain advantages in the implementation of Partnerships. France has yet made greater use of the model, in particular in the operation of existing toll roads. In fact PPPs are not adapted to greenfield investments and are typically formed to explore the operational and management expertise of the private sector. As such, Partnerships would be a perfect tool in the US which is in need of pressing road maintenance investments. Provided the United States addresses the misconceptions that exist on PPPs among the American public and continues to promote a favorable regulatory environment, only political will would remain in the way of making Public-Private Partnerships the preferred American way of providing for highway infrastructure.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b16b53c8083dc7903b1b377714e0be29"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Business and Economic Law</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5ee3cb457730742bfcf2515d613fabda" level="item"><did><unittitle>Developing an Effective Way Forward: U.S. Public Diplomacy in the Middle East</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Schaefer, Katherine</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_166200a441e7122dc13e7700f8401bb0">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract:  This paper analyzes the main factors that contributed to the outbreak of the Karabakh war and those that continue to perpetuate it. The stalemate over Karabakh is assessed on the domestic, regional and international levels to come to a deeper understanding of what is preventing peace in the region. The patterns of globalization that have transformed the South Caucasus since the collapse of the Soviet Union provide the context for this study. I conclude that there are three main obstacles preventing a settlement: The inherent weakness of the Azerbaijani and Armenian states which is exacerbated by the Western push for democratization; the interference of outside actors who indirectly or directly perpetuate the conflict through their engagement in the region; and the overall militarization of the Caucasus in order to secure petroleum interests. This paper ultimately aims to provide insight into the nature of the conflict and the reasons for the continual instability in the region. While not providing policy recommendations, per se, it is hoped that a deeper analysis of these factors will be of use when considering approaches to the conflict and policy making in the South Caucasus.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_be8d23542db77fce849dff00e64761e7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c51ec0733c0774b34cc1fc968daf5c9f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Media Independence: Variables Affecting Freedom of the Press: Cross-Country Regression Analysis with Implications on Russian Media</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00016</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Simonyan, Armine</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_465554f91c95664492ebe388b98acd3b">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  Freedom of speech and of the press is one of the fundamental human rights protected by the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, as well as by the constitutions and laws of many countries. However, the degree to which the states exercise the full freedom of the press varies across countries. The governments of many countries restrict full media independence by imposing censorship, financially supporting and providing policy guidance to media outlets, as well as limiting journalists  rights. This paper analyzes different levels of the state and media relationship, such as manufactured consent, market for loyalties and the CNN effect on different examples, including the media and state relationships in Russia. The  media and society interrelation model  is developed to show different media and society relations on examples of democratic, religious and economic societies. Variables that influence the level of media independence in a given country that are considered in this analysis are economic freedom, freedom of religion, the level of income distribution in the country, density of population and others. The quantitative analysis proves that there is a strong relationship between these variables and the freedom of the press. The implication of the results of this analysis is that full media independence in a given country can be provided only if democratic institutions are enforced and protected, the full religious freedom is exercised and the economic policies toward higher economic freedom are implemented. Similarly, if a new-formed Russian society tends towards a greater societal openness through exercising the full freedom of the press, it should take into account the importance of providing and protecting political rights and civil liberties, as well as religious and economic freedoms. Achieving this goal would mean that the freedom of the press stated in the Constitution of Russian Federation is not a fabrication, but a reality to be exercised for the well-being and prosperity of the nation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2b8674c4d7703a7d03d7c275442068fd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3dd974ca7bb22676a564e7ef52a917bf" level="item"><did><unittitle>Violence and Voices: Armed Political Opposition Groups' Interaction with the Foreign News Media</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00017</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Spiros, Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_bee9bf98dc08aa6520b941f712e44797">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  This thesis analyzes violent behavior towards news reporters by armed political opposition during armed conflicts. Specifically, it seeks to determine if, based on recent increases in violence against reporters in Iraq in particular, if there is a general shift in the attitude of such groups towards reporters and a new norm of viewing foreign reporters as combatants. To do this, a new framework was developed that consciously extends the existing models of the role of the press in international conflicts to include the proclivity of armed political opposition groups to view foreign reporters as combatants and use violence against them. Ultimately it is determined that there is no fundamental change, and that the framework explains the different attitudes of armed opposition groups tow! ards reporters. Instead, the increase in violence reflects the Iraq situation specifically, which is characterised with more such opposition groups than seen in past conflicts and more having the characteristics of the most violent towards reporters, as described by the developed framework.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ab2f37ca79a60ba17e64763d0376f1eb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_22a08e3ca4cd63c3ba3d02628310218e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Terror-Crime Nexus?

Abstract:  This paper examines the links between terrorism and arms, drug, and human trafficking in Georgia. It recognizes the increasing nexus between international terrorism and transnational organized crime in Georgia and the South Caucasus in general. Specifically, it considers 1) the rise and threat of international terrorism and transnational organized crime, 2) the transnational significance of the geography, society, and political systems and economies in the Caucasus, 3) the indicators of terror-crime collusion in Georgia specifically, and 4) the policy implications to counter the terror-crime nexuses. A qualitative study, this paper uses a methodology called Preparation of the Investigation Environment (PIE) to determine the existence and extent of collusion between terrorists and organized criminals. This methodology was developed by American University s Transnational Crime and Corruption Center (TraCCC) under a Department of Justice grant and resulted in a paper entitled, Methods and Motives: Exploring Links between Transnational Organized Crime &amp; International Terrorism. This framework provides a terror-crime interaction spectrum, which results in five categories of terror-crime collusion and utilizes twelve indicators to analyze interaction. Analysis in this study led to the following collusions: First, terrorists and organized criminals are using the same routes as arms, drug, and human traffickers. Second, terrorists are financing their activities from drugs and arms trafficking, but not human trafficking. As a result, third, terrorists can be more effectively countered by the penetration of drug and arms trafficking networks.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a58d8fa1390353ac53640c7604190f59"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_71b226524a3d7dd913b6aaa16a58c557" level="item"><did><unittitle>Sub-Optimal Equilibriums in the Carbon Forestry Game: Why Bamboo Should Win but Will Not</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.073.00019</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Widenoja, Raya</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9468aff8733eb2ae1a1e1b1e655d8af2">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:   So far in the competition for recognition of forestry projects under the CDM, little attention has been paid to the comparative advantage of different trees species. Yet once the first carbon revenues start rolling in, it would be logical for project planners to turn their attention to maximizing revenues with products that store the most carbon per hectare (ha). Indeed, in the academic world, many papers have already been written about the comparative advantage of different tree species with the expectation that forestry projects would be planned to maximize carbon sequestration. This paper begins with evidence that a non-tree speciesbamboomay be one of the species most well-suited to the CDM s goals of maximizing carbon revenues and promoting sustainable development. Noting however, that no CDM projects have been or are being prepared for bamboo, it asks, if bamboo should be the rational choice for project developers, and if it is then what is leading the developers to make sub-optimal decisions. This paper finds that project developers are not focusing on competitive carbon sequestration rates or optimal sustainability because of high transaction costs, high risk of non-approval, and low carbon revenues. Further, sustainability is given a back seat in the project design because there are few financial paybacks for sustainability: most of the external benefits are still not captured in the price. The main conclusion of this study is that national governments and the CDM Executive Board should support forestry projects with more capacity development and financial support in order to attain the goals set out for the Clean Development Mechanism.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_616db3fd91d27dd37b84e32ae427ed11"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">International Environment and Resource Policy</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commercial Policies</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_be5578c492621977871bce2e63515bef" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards a National Information Infrastructure Initiative for the United States: An Analysis of Global Broadband Deployment, Adoption and Policies for Enhancement</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bennett, Andrew</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_04f716e38e50bf689fdf76a54e092098">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  High-bandwidth Internet connectivity is proving to be critical infrastructure for the 21st Century and national leaders are looking to shape existing policies and identify new policy tools and initiatives to stimulate the enhancement and expansion of broadband infrastructure. There are a wide variety of national and market-specific factors thought to facilitate increased broadband deployment and adoption of the technology. Demand factors like levels of income, education, and age; supply factors like the existence of legacy infrastructure that can be converted to broadband or the local population density; factors related to the competitive market like price, quality of service, and the number of providers; and policy factors that might ease market entry or incentivize innovation and build-! out of existing infrastructure are all potential drivers of broadband penetration. This thesis presents a broad survey of these factors through the existing econometric literature, next tests these factors through regression analysis, and then examines the broadband market at work in a case-study review of the impact of these factors. The concluding analysis answers the following question: what are the key market factors driving broadband penetration among the leading nations? What are the available policy tools that have been proven to positively stimulate the drivers of broadband deployment and adoption? Is there room for improvement in the United States when it comes to broadband and if so, how can policies that have proved successful in other nations be adapted and applied to the U.S. context?</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c54cbdeadc48c49e788d6e40138f875d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bd5a7a51661c56cef052531cff7b2156" level="item"><did><unittitle>If We Could Hear &amp; Read Their Stories: A Comparative Analysis of Perpetrator Patterns &amp; Community Responses to Sexual Violence in Liberia &amp; Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Birch, Kathryn</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_eadf4ef3405b9b03644995746f040a69">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict societies is a security, public health, and human rights issue, and an act of aggression against a nation or community. The prevalence and severity of sexual violence in Liberia and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as subsequent health and socio-economic consequences have fundamentally changed these societies. Protection strategies employed by the victims and community responses to sexual violence have helped shape these changes. Further, discriminatory legal and social dimensions, such as women's second-class status, can help create a context in which sexual violence perpetuates. While rape has been recognized as a war crime and a crime against humanity, little is known about the protection strategies adopted by victims and their communities and how these strategies impact society. The context in which the violence occurs, the protection strategies employed and community responses must be better understood in order to develop appropriate responses for: punishing perpetrators of sexual violence; protecting and caring for the victims; and reintegrating victims into communities, to provide healing and reconciliation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4eef321fd5637f702796896be429f44d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_513abd6662a924d20bfdfc40554ca592" level="item"><did><unittitle>Never Again?

Abstract: Following the Holocaust, the international community vowed to Ònever againÓ stand by and witness the perpetration of genocide. This has since proved to be an empty promise, however, as since 1945 the world has stood by and watched several genocides happen without intervening. Nowhere is this so clear as in the case of Rwanda. The story of Rwanda is a tragedy on its own Ð 800,000 people were massacred in the space of 100 days Ð but it is made even more so by the fact that this genocide could have been prevented at several junctures. Even after the killing had commenced, even a small international commitment of troops and support could have saved more than half of the eventual victims. With its passivity, the Western world condemned hundreds of thousands of innocent people to death, and the guilt of that inaction will never fade. The Western media played a vital role in facilitating that inaction. The lack of coverage in general made it easy for the West to ignore the situation, and when the media did cover the genocide, they framed the coverage in such a way as to tacitly support Western policies of non-intervention. Finally, once the media did grasp on to the tragedy of Rwanda, they continued to ignore the killing and focused instead on the more attractive story of the flood of refugees that left the country in the wake of the genocide. The international community and the Western media together helped facilitate the extermination of 800,000 people. It was an atrocity that could have been averted.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fa07a17c9dbf6fae09c9280847953f0e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_64a4bcca8515557c3838a2f7910efbb4" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Story of Communication, Power and Vision: Bringing Guatemalan Civil Society into the National Decision-Making Process</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gagnon, Laurie</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7015965cc2b51e0710dd889acf036c52">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This thesis explores how national-level civil society might be more effective in advocating for the reduction of inequality and exclusion in GuatemalaÕs post-conflict peace process. National decision-making processes affect a majority of the population and are a necessary component for reducing inequality and promoting inclusion. What factors prevent organized civil society from having a more significant influence on these processes? This thesis begins with a brief political history that identifies the key actors in historical context and maps the existing power structures. Then, the analysis defines civil society, based on the current context and literature, in order to determine where civil society in Guatemala fits into this picture. Finally, the thesis uses this analysis as a tool to propose strategies that could enable civil society to effectively negotiate a more prominent role in promoting the vision of the Peace Accords by addressing the underlying structures of socioeconomic exclusion and human insecurity. The three main recommendations are to 1) promote synergies within civil society at multiple levels, 2) forge connections with economic elites, and 3) foster broader understanding at all levels of society.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2372d9aa998dd664a0c90728e656915a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e9895d6befeb2736b7bdf2aec8773866" level="item"><did><unittitle>Violence Prevention Through Bodybuilding</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Goudkov, Dmitri</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b95e71eb38266e5fffa06c103ba2e0c2">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  The current study focuses on young men around the world in their teens and twenties who are considered at risk -- that is, those young men who have no access to education and economic opportunities and who have no stabilizing social anchors, such as family, teachers, coaches, church, and friends. These men are at risk of feeling less masculine. Their emasculation then leads to low self-esteem, and it is the fundamental assumption of this study that such young men with low self-esteem see violence as their last resort to regain their self-esteem and self-respect at the expense of their own or other people's lives. Bodybuilding offers an alternative route to higher self-esteem. A number of factors set bodybuilding apart from other sports that offer the same approach to violence prevention. First, building muscular bodies already attracts millions of young men around the world. Second, bodybuilding is a rare sport, in which progress, a more muscular body, is visible to all. Progress in most other sports is visible only as young men play them. Third, bodybuilding is not competitive, which avoids the danger of many contact sports that thrive on competition. Last, but not least, bodybuilding is self-perpetuating and self-reliant, long after an official bodybuilding program is over. As with anything powerful, bodybuilding can be counterproductive if left to its own devices, but this study offers ways to avoid potential pitfalls; it has addressed the issue of testosterone, abuse of steroids, and disconnect between bodybuilding and reality. Just as martial arts reduce aggressive tendencies when they focus on self-actualization rather than simply self-defense, bodybuilding can ultimately prevent violence when, instead of getting trapped in the narcissism of bodybuilding, young men learn that controlling their destinies is similar to controlling their muscles.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c84cc9b76caf562d547ae14d88e1b7c7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b4bb0277a9f7daa5c413059dcec57828" level="item"><did><unittitle>Maintaining Socially-Inclusive Economic Growth By Enabling Opportunity: Achieving Sustainable Development in Vietnam</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Huynh, Hai</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_90d8f3f7efcaea2da74712e55c807c48">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  Throughout its development, Vietnam has proceeded with caution in its experimentation with market mechanisms and global integration, employing substantial measures to reduce poverty through socially-inclusive economic growth. The past decade in Vietnam can be characterized by robust economic development and absolute poverty decline premised upon extensive legal and economic reform, increased foreign investment, industry-wide deregulation and privatization, and the awakening of a long-suppressed entrepreneurial spirit. This paper presents industry and competitive analyses of VietnamÕs telecommunications and banking sectors and explores the effect of a gap in access to these services on continued entrepreneurial opportunity and socially-inclusive economic development. The main argument against the importance of the provision of access to telecommunications and financial services to impoverished communities is the traditional belief that these products are of marginal value to populations struggling to cope with physical and economic security. I argue to the contrary, that convenient and affordable access to these services can generate entrepreneurial opportunity and income enough to mitigate many of the physical and fiscal challenges that afflict the poor. I propose that the effective provision of universal access to these services requires comprehensive privatization, increased competition, cross-sector convergence, and the hybridization of the lower cost structure and network effects of mobile telephony with the high sunk cost infrastructure inherent in traditional banking and information exchange networks. The achievement of these targets can allow for a more affordable and accessible service that will reach a larger, more cost sensitive user base. The significant reduction in the cost of use, coupled with a marked enhancement of the value-offer, will result in the broad delivery of connectivity, financial services and information exchange. This in turn, will bolster entrepreneurial upstarts of all sizes, create employment, link and strengthen the private sector, and generate socially-inclusive economic growth in Vietnam.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_670dc3bca31def9847059796031fec50"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">Law and Development</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ccda1519a08d7b9c56dc6942bab0493a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Of Peace and Justice: The Impact of Human Rights in Peacemaking</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lanz, David</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_551222276cc533cd25321c99190d356b">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  The nexus of human rights and peacemaking constitutes a highly significant feature of post-Cold War international conflict intervention. However, its understanding and conceptualization by advocates, policy-makers, and academics remains unsatisfactory. The nature of the interplay between peacemaking and human rights Ð or between peace and justice Ð is often described in simplistic terms. In policy circles, human rights and peacemaking are often portrayed as either completely antagonistic Ð peace versus justice Ð or as inherently compatible Ð no peace without justice. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to get at the heart of the interplay between peace and justice in order to grasp the complexity of the impact of human rights in peace negotiations. It concludes that while peacemaking and human rights are generally compatible, a fundamentalist promotion of norms in the context of peace negotiations, without regard to opportunity costs and alternative strategies, can lead to negative outcomes. In order to mitigate this, human rights should be deployed pragmatically taking into account their impact in terms of conflict resolution.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fb9eda63d09b69e146b2c3f22f6c6a79"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">Public International Law</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_26f68d13e157bfeaf6c6bd4d3edf4ff7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Distributional and Welfare Effects of Including Corn into NAFTA and the Social, Economic, Political and International Repercussions for Mexico</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mendoza, Sylvia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_be9e7f26663e25b2ca9c54c01f241c62">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  This thesis explores the possible causal relationship between an increase in inequality and poverty in Mexico and the inclusion of corn into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Since trade in this crop is mainly between Mexico and the United States, trade with Canada will not be taken into consideration. This analysis uses several economic parameters that determine which groups of the population are affected by maize price drops and supply and demand shifts, such as budget allocations, an Engel curve, the determination of buyers and sellers, and cross-price elasticities of white and yellow corn. The elimination of the Mexican State Trading Enterprise, CONASUPO, is used as a base case in order to determine if NAFTA was indeed what caused these adverse distributional effects. To determi! ne these effects and the different economic parameters used, econometric studies and models by Antonio Yunez-Naude, Alain de Janvry, and Santiago Levy, among others, are described and analyzed. This thesis concludes that NAFTA has caused some but not all of the documented adverse distributional effects. The analysis outlines policy recommendations and briefly describes possibilities for renegotiation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3075576debfb33b61bec1a5412817aee"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local"> International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local"> International Trade and Commercial Policies</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2123e56cdd74051846f8067ed09eb5b1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Resuscitating 'The Forgotten Sector in a Forgotten State': Catalyzing Improved Health Outcomes in Guinea-Bissau through the Millennium Development Goals</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Murphy, Stephen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4e1bf3ab33ee861e57e3b0345b3dc0b1">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  The citizens of Guinea-Bissau suffer among the worst health indicators in the world. Poor health, education, and economic development in the country stem from weak governance and insufficient and volatile aid flows. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Guinea-Bissau has joined other low-income countries in embracing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Ministry of Public Health in Guinea-Bissau seeks to reform health care through an emphasis on the MDGs. The individual MDGs provide concrete health targets, and the governmentÕs commitment to their collective pursuit has inspired reinvigorated planning and coordination. Given the strong role of improved health outcomes in fostering poverty reduction, Guinea-BissauÕs achievement of the health-related MDGs could have spill-over effects far beyond the health sector. With technical assistance from the World Bank and the United Nations, the Ministry of Public Health is leading a campaign to deliver high-quality, affordable care through improvements in health infrastructure, human resources, and health financing. Instituting user-fee and cost-recovery reforms remain its top priorities. Reforms beyond the health sector related to agriculture, infrastructure, education, and water and sanitation can also contribute substantially to the health-related MDGs. With effective governmental stewardship across ministries and adequate assistance from international partners, the Ministry of Public HealthÕs strategic plan for reform holds the potential to accelerate Guinea-BissauÕs achievement of the health-related MDGs. However, renewed political instability or inconsistent donor support could jeopardize progress.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1de8ed81bfd509c0e5ae6657a056613e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Organizations</subject><subject source="local">International Political Economy</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_32bae24c779240d7ad0820fd1c5a91bb" level="item"><did><unittitle>NGO Mission and Staff Perception: A Case Study of the Finca del Niño</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Myette, Michael-John</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a83d8fa527bd0acc83263f6909ccf337">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  In the non-profit world much is made of the importance of a well-conceived and constructed mission and mission statement that is operationalized by a strategic plan. This paper argues that these organizational tools are important but are not sufficient for mission-effectiveness to be effective criteria for decision making within an organization. The paper argues that employee perception is a key part of transforming mission from an organizational planning tool into a set of criteria that permeates decision at the level of the organization, but also at the level of individual staff members. The paper investigates these ideas through a case study of the Finca del Niño, a small orphanage on the North Coast of Honduras. The first section of the paper investigates staff perception of the organizationÕs mission through interviews conducted with 28 staff members. The second section of the paper takes this understanding of the role of staff perception of the mission and applies it to a decision making process. It first outlines a policy analysis framework that can be used to evaluate a decision based on mission effectiveness and then traces the decision making process within the Finca del Niño. The paper then makes recommendations for further conversations within the Finca. Topics for these conversations include indicators for success of the mission, the mechanics of how mission is transmitted within the organization, the impact of turnover on community and how the unity of mission and vision can be maintained as a new leadership structure is put into place in Fall 2008. Finally the paper argues that the Finca del Niño represents an example of how staff perception can transform an organizationÕs mission statement from a formal tool for organizational use into a practical set of criteria for individual decision making.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fa8e96a8988449a56e7257bcd63a16e9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_eb02d2683c72037d0ed8a1b383072db4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards a Framework for Culturally-Sensitive Psychosocial Interventions in the Population of Internally Displaced Sudanese</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Neff, Brian</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_df7bd416501bbd25868b1bfb929dacda">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The mental health effects of violence are, in the words of trauma research pioneer Richard Mollica, Òinvisible woundsÓ that until very recently have received tragically scant attention. Today, there is an emerging consensus in humanitarian and public health circles that there can be no physical health without mental health. Distressingly, a recent Lancet series found Òwidespread systematic, and long-term neglect of resources for mental health care in low-income and middle-income countriesÓ Ð home to most of the 450 million currently suffering from mental problems Ð meaning that help is out of reach for most of those who need it. What emerges from this reality is the need for humanitarian mental health interventions alongside other complex emergency interventions where a disaster- or violence-impacted population lacks adequate access to psychological care. In fact, mental health has become in the last fifteen years an increasingly integral component of some humanitarian relief programs. But a cadre of skeptics considers the application of Western psychological concepts Ð particularly the model of "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder" to non-Western cultures both ethnocentric and arrogant, not to mention ineffectual and potentially harmful. It is true that even the best-intentioned psychosocial intervention, if poorly grounded in the local culture, can do more harm than good. But this does not mean that psychosocial interventions in complex emergencies are not ethically warranted when a population has little or no access to mental health care, and it does not mean that interventions cannot be made exceptionally culturally-sensitive, drawing on the expertise of local healers and staying loyal to the essence of what a particular community believes about wellness and illness, functionality and non-functionality, purpose and meaning, life and death. This paper seeks to contribute to making the case for culturally-sensitive psychosocial interventions in one especially traumatized population Sudan's internally displaced. After contextualizing the country's crisis of forced migration, surveying its anemic mental health services, and delving deeper into the psychological fallout of the displacement experience to solidify a moral imperative to intervene where there is nowhere for the traumatized to turn, it moves from theory to practice, investigating how mental health interventions in Sudan can be made culturally sensitive through deeper understanding of Sudanese conceptions and manifestations of mental distress. It serves as a practical guide for psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and other helping professionals who participate in internationally-led psychosocial programs in SudanÕs IDP camps.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6fc8be5d72cb7569344691560a6eb946"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Organizations</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_12b4663831db52b8031f2be4590e571c" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Right to a Fair Trial in States of Emergencies: Non-Derogable Aspects of Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Schmid, Evelyne</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c25f8b665fd0b2acb81656c894956163">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  This thesis examines international norms of fair trial in states of emergency. It identifies the list of judicial safeguards which have to be provided to every accused individual, irrespective of his or her status in international law and irrespective of whether the situation amounts to an armed conflict or not. It shows that current legal discussions about the applicable law in the Òwar on terrorÓ do not sufficiently recognize that a minimum floor of due process must be provided to all accused; regardless of whether humanitarian treaty law applies or not. Specifically, this thesis proceeds from the assertion that human rights law applies in peacetime as well as in times of emergency, including in armed conflict. Building on two Advisory Opinions of the International Court of Justice, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights applies as long as a State party has not made a valid derogation from its provisions. The Covenant prohibits any derogations that would be inconsistent with the states other obligations under international law. Applying this principle of consistency to the administration of justice, it is possible to identify which aspects fair trial (article 14 of the Covenant) must be considered non-derogable. This thesis argues that those aspects of fair trial which are common to the legal regimes dealing with international armed conflict on the one hand and internal armed conflicts on the other must be provided in all types of emergencies, including those which fall short of the legal threshold of an armed conflict. The author finds that at least twelve aspects of fair trial constitute the minimum floor of due process. Any derogation from these aspects would be inconsistent with customary law Ð which is binding on all states Ð and therefore be invalid. This framework provides a strong contention against arguments that certain individuals are situated in legal gray zones between human rights law and international humanitarian law where the current framework of international law does not apply. The twelve non-derogable aspects of fair trial are the minimum yardstick from which no reduction is permissible. It's time that we end the infinite quarrels about the legal norms applicable to detainees in the Òwar on terrorÓ and hold our governments accountable for the protection of, at the very least, the non-derogable rights of the detainees under their authority.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_282d6bb9fe257dcc856f181e38071488"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Public International Law</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_64abaf019e342cc9b39847ab94510f12" level="item"><did><unittitle>Farm Animal Welfare and WTO Law: Assessing the Legality of Policy Measures</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sharpless, Ike</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b417eda6a4b4983ab4b359bd3123b2ca">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

The array of available policy measures includes: labeling, differential tariffs and taxes, import bans and other quantitative restrictions, green box measures, and special and differential treatment. In light of the Appellate Body jurisprudence to date on the SPS and TBT Agreements and on GATT Articles III, XI, and XX, the optimal policy basket of measures is a combination of labeling, tariffs, green box measures, special and differential treatment, and coordination with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8733b57429aa4eefaa35a0f23db4abf8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">International Trade and Commercial Policies</subject><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_17432d357bf017a565a0d37c02c68166" level="item"><did><unittitle>Adopem Bank: Microfinance in the Dominican Republic, A Case Study</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.074.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sumser, Heidi</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2008">2008</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4aaf36dd44ef496989eb2697294e5059">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: The purpose of this thesis is to explore the literature about the intersection of climate change and environmental processes, and human migration. While this topic is not new, there has been increased and intensive attention to the field within the past 10 years. Several patterns have emerged from the study and the discussion of this subject. One is the evolution of the literature from more general predictions about climate change, environmental events such as desertification and sea level rise, and population growth and migration, to more specialized studies on the direct impact of climate change and the environment on migration. At the same time, the few completed studies that have been conducted conclude inconsistent and conflicting results about climate and environment induced migration. This leads to the other pattern: diverging views on how to conceptualize the subject and its implications for the protection of climate change migrants, and on whether and how to create and implement policy to ensure protection. Thus, this state of the art review will track the discussions and provide some analysis of debates.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_26e48a961cc5f248d8c34d9b49bf573d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d930f92ecdb8de1880283816fe01ac02" level="item"><did><unittitle>Resuscitating 'the Forgotten Sector in a Forgotten State': Catalyzing Improved Health Outcomes in Guinea-Bissau through the Millennium Development Goals</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Murphy, Stephen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c4565498230240d91cbdd75cdf912312">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The citizens of Guinea-Bissau suffer among the worst health indicators in the world. Poor health, education, and economic development in the country stem from weak governance and insufficient and volatile aid flows. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Guinea-Bissau has joined other low-income countries in embracing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Ministry of Public Health in Guinea-Bissau seeks to reform health care through an emphasis on the MDGs. The individual MDGs provide concrete health targets, and the government's commitment to their collective pursuit has inspired reinvigorated planning and coordination. Given the strong role of improved health outcomes in fostering poverty reduction, Guinea-Bissau's achievement of the health-related MDGs could have spill-over effects far beyond the health sector. With technical assistance from the World Bank and the United Nations, the Ministry of Public Health is leading a campaign to deliver high-quality, affordable care through improvements in health infrastructure, human resources, and health financing. Instituting user-fee and cost-recovery reforms remain its top priorities. Reforms beyond the health sector related to agriculture, infrastructure, education, and water and sanitation can also contribute substantially to the health-related MDGs. With effective governmental stewardship across ministries and adequate assistance from international partners, the Ministry of Public Health's strategic plan for reform holds the potential to accelerate Guinea-Bissau's achievement of the health-related MDGs. However, renewed political instability or inconsistent donor support could jeopardize progress.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_28f930cee65e8b84b9bc1e0fd575b840"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Organizations</subject><subject source="local">International Political Economy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8cc60bb2a16b9031a26f96200d663c2e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Achieving Complex National Security Missions: A Multidisciplinary Approach to the Design and Management of Collaborative Institutions</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Iverson, Erik</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_34cff253d3cccbce9607ae8848ab471d">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The diffuse national security challenges facing the United States today require that we not only reform the institutions that defend this country, but that we also reassess how we think about national security. Today's challenges bear little semblance to those of Harry Truman's time. Today's government only faintly resembles the bureaucracy of Max Weber's writings. Yet America's national security institutions have changed comparatively little since 1947. More importantly, the way in which we think about government organization has not kept pace with the shifting realities of contemporary governance. This paper argues that the United States can improve the effectiveness of its national security institutions by improving their capacity to achieve unity of effort with one another. In order to do this, however, it is first necessary to change how we think about bureaucracy. Traditional bureaucratic theory must be updated to reflect the realities of the complex and increasingly interdependent mission space within which today's organizations operate. National security reform and reorganization should be guided by a new analytic construct that more precisely describes the determinants of institutional success in the execution of collaborative missions. Unlike traditional bureaucratic analyses, the analytic construct proposed herein begins to explain why some bureaucratic institutions succeed in collaborative endeavors while others fail. The first four sections of this paper establish the foundation of knowledge from which the proposed analytic construct is derived. Analysis of the history of America's national security institutions, bureaucratic theory, and the national security literature inform the development of this new analytic framework. The first section of this paper will briefly describe the genesis and evolution of the modern national security system since the National Security Act of 1947. The second section will analyze traditional bureaucratic theory over the course of history and synthesize the most relevant contemporary theory into a unified analytic framework. The third section will evaluate the American national security system's effectiveness in the current international security environment. The fourth section will build upon the conclusions of the existing literature to make a pointed case for national security reform in the near-term. Furthermore, this section will argue that traditional bureaucratic theory is insufficient to guide contemporary reform efforts in the modern interagency environment. These first sections of the paper describe a host of complex problems, cross-cutting issues, and distinct challenges confronting American national security institutions. Ensuing analysis identifies three meta-level problems: novel threats confronting a predominantly static national security system, dis-unity of effort across the executive branch, and a dearth of strategic planning across the U.S. Government. These challenges are both multi-dimensional and cross-disciplinary; they are present, to varying degrees, at the national, operational, and intergovernmental levels of analysis, and they cut across an increasingly broad spectrum of disciplines. In the section entitled Principles of Reform, this paper distills eight major principles of reform concerning: the scope of national security, unity of effort, the vitality of institutions, planning and resource allocation, national security workforce integration, information sharing and knowledge management, civilian control of the military, and accountability and oversight. In so doing, this paper makes two important points. First, it demonstrates that many of the fundamental issues that constrain the performance of the American national security system are inherently bureaucratic. Paradoxically, however, it also argues that the solutions to these bureaucratic problems can no longer be found in traditional bureaucratic theory. This paper demonstrates that the analytic constructs of traditional bureaucratic theory have limited descriptive and explanatory value when applied to contemporary institutions. Like the Cold War American national security establishment, bureaucratic theory has failed to evolve with the times. The final sections of this paper propose, develop, and test an analytic construct that begins to address this crucial knowledge gap. This paper argues that four discrete factors are of paramount importance in the design and management of collaborative bureaucratic organizations: 1. Authorities; 2. Resources and capabilities; 3. Information and knowledge management; and 4. Accountability and oversight. These factors do not represent the sum total of the variables that can affect the performance of modern bureaucratic organizations. Rather, these are the four factors that matter most according to the historical, theoretical, and analytic sources synthesized in this paper. This paper proposes a detailed analytic framework for assessing each of these factors in the section entitled Theory Building. The utility of this analytic lens is demonstrated in this paper through the side-by-side application of a traditional bureaucratic analysis (defined in the section entitled Traditional Bureaucratic Theory) and a bureaucratic analysis focused on the four factors outlined above to a set of contemporary cases. The section entitled Case Studies examines three very distinct cases at the national, operational, and intergovernmental levels of analysis. The subjects selected--the National Counter Terrorism Center, the Provincial Reconstruction Teams of Afghanistan/Iraq, and the Arizona State Counter Terrorism Information Center--are each responsible for integrating cross-disciplinary and interorganizational capabilities in discrete contextual circumstances. They are broadly representative of a new class of collaborative institutions designed to bridge critical seams between departments, disciplines, and levels of government. There is no singular formula for success to be derived from this analysis; every carefully-defined problem requires a carefully-calibrated solution. Instead, this analysis is significant because it describes the determinants of bureaucratic effectiveness in today's networked organizational environment and begins to set the intellectual foundation necessary to build a more integrated national security system populated by a new breed of collaborative bureaucratic institutions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6b3c22ae0eaa12c4b616065413da5513"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f6c06c501b4f59787fb39a818323b1e1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Azerbaijan and Israel: Oil, Islam and Strawberries Pragmatism in Foreign Policy Between Unlikely Allies</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Marcus, Robert</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_07cb74fca293bd455d0af5830d61add9">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: In the age of rapid economic development and uneven allocation of hydrocarbon resources around the world, acute need for their transportation and amplified energy dependency world politics is and will in the coming years be increasingly dominated if not determined by the energy. Contest to gain access to the Caspian energy and rivalry about transportation routes should be viewed within this context. In addition to their own merit the hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea are used by external players for broader objectives of dominance and influence, while the local actors brought them into play for economic development, social welfare, political consolidation, creation of forthcoming and stable regional environment and integrating into world economy. International players making use of their financial potential and political influence, sometimes even military strength, and the Caspian countries proceeding from their complex political surrounding and taking advantage of their resources and favorable geographic location resorted to geopolitics in pursuit of their ends. Turkic-Mongol empires dominated Eurasia during the centuries promoted and facilitated extensive trade, economic, cultural, religious, scientific exchanges across continent along the trade routes known as Great Silk Road. These connections in huge landmasses of Eurasia were possible in addition to such values as tolerance and mutual respect due to perfect communications means. 21st century presents another opportunity for such exchanges, this time through energy links. The Caspian Sea should be region uniting, not dividing Eurasia through co-operation and partnership, not rivalry and opposition. The Caspian is pivot of Heartland. Who co-operates in the Caspian commands Eurasia.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_752cbf68e69e730ac64f0147ade50d32"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cc252c45f0b30d6f57c34278c9211fa7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Collaborative Value Sharing Between Profit and NonProfit Partners in Emerging Markets: The Case of GrameenPhone in Bangladesh</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hoq, Sajedul</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d6fc5ea295c65816ac08f1b3b086630d">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Cross-sector partnerships are increasingly gaining popularity as consumers become more aware of responsible business practices. In the course of following the advanced economies of the world, emerging market economies are also experiencing trends of partnerships between business and nonprofit sectors. For emerging markets, such partnerships provide additional values by filling the gap between the government's capacity and the country's economic and infrastructural needs. This study examines the cross-sector value sharing between a nonprofit and a business entity operating in Bangladesh through a number of case studies. GrameenPhone, a partnership between Telenor, a business corporation from Norway and Grameen Telecom (GTC), a nonprofit organization in Bangladesh, has been selected for this research as this partnership has become popular around the world for its success and, recently for a few of its disputes. To structure the research the study utilizes the analytical frameworks developed by Harvard Business School Professor James E. Austin. It uses the Collaboration Continuum framework to analyze how the partnership was formed and what the partner's relative positions are now. Then, this study uses the Collaboration Value Construct framework to evaluate the partnerss value sharing and evolution as a partnership. After thorough research and theoretical analysis, this study reports its findings, comments on the trends and attempts to answer the thesis question. It finally ends with citing the limitations experienced in the course of the investigation and recommendations for future research on the findings and related theoretical topics.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c3a5c4f81dc66119f1583ab423a61d2b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commercial Policies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2f229cdd92e6eac8cfdba98ca6b91a85" level="item"><did><unittitle>Creating Obstacles to Peace: The International Involvement in Darfur</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Erdmannsdoerfer, Viola</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a97c8040624f7fd9d1e9fdf03a954160">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The conflict in Darfur raises the question why despite the high levels of international attention and involvement so little progress has been made over the last six years. This thesis is going to suggest that the misalignment of strategies and objectives by the international community itself has contributed to creating the main obstacles to a settlement of the conflict: the ICC arrest warrant for President Al-Bashir and the fragmentation of the armed opposition groups. Regarding the amount of additional human suffering caused by these interventions, some standards have to be found to hold the international community accountable.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ff1d6ca4e9e506dc8aa2aaa049fe2218"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">International Organizations</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c8fad592436a7e7d65b56da738b09539" level="item"><did><unittitle>How to Assess Corruption in Defence: A Framework for Designing, Comparing and Interpreting Corruption Measurement Tools</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Reiling, Kirby</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_523f6a025d82f3b30424628cf3d8192e">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This report provides guidance for measuring corruption in the defence sector. It lays out a series of conceptual frameworks for designing, comparing and interpreting corruption measurement tools, including suggestions for how to adapt general corruption indicators to defence. The report is divided into four sections. The first offers an exposition on the problem of defence corruption, its forms and consequences. The second section applies programme design principles to clarify how understandings of corruption and theories of change can inform a measurement endeavour. The third section is a structured review of four general approaches to measuring corruption, including descriptions of several major indexes in the field. Finally, the fourth section explores how the design principles and measurement approaches could be applied to the defence sector.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4345cf734ee80a900d8dfd2ba5c9f2ba"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2d41c5b5ffc518b1eda996b59876d935" level="item"><did><unittitle>Prospect of Energy Link Between Central Asia and China: A Study on the Development of 'Energy Silk Route,' the Turkmenistan - China Pipeline</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kamiya, Masato</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c63ba99688843e55b0c7da021592fad1">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: As the global economy grows at an unprecedented pace and with broader interactions among states and populations, energy has become an increasingly critical issue. Historically, energy resources have been a source of competition and discord among states, rather than a focus of cooperation. In fact, states have gone to war pursuing energy resources available within other nation states. In the contemporary world, states have agreements with others for energy cooperation and sharing infrastructures, and global markets to exchange energy commodities have been developed. However, the system for distributing energy resources that are spread unequally throughout the world still require greater investment and more effective strategies to allocate capital and technology to mitigate conflicts and create opportunities for stakeholder cooperation. Meanwhile, debates over energy issues are often complicated by various factors related to politics, economics and technology, and the confusion that stems from many these various aspects often conceals fundamental issues and hinders the establishment of appropriate policies. This thesis emphasizes the economic rationale of the development of a new international energy infrastructure and examines the reasons why stakeholders make huge investments to transport energy resources across national borders.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8f952b2e9f5120776820593a19501ae3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Environment and Resource Policy</subject><subject source="local">International Political Economy</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commercial Policies</subject><subject source="local">Pacific Asia</subject><subject source="local">Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7426f09ce8619966fafb2e9f0067d465" level="item"><did><unittitle>Additionality of the Clean Development Mechanism: Insights from Central American Case Studies</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lindsay, Abby</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ba400b23b4913a370d97d3bd37903175">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: As part of the global response to climate change, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was developed to involve developing countries in emission reductions by allowing them to sell developed countries carbon credits generated from emission-reducing projects. The CDM theoretically should help developing countries implement renewable energy, thus contributing to sustainable development, so this study focuses on the interaction between renewable energy, the CDM, and small developing countries. It analyzes the barriers to projects and the decision-making factors that determine whether or not projects are pursued in Honduras and Costa Rica. A host of barriers were found throughout the study, ranging from low electricity production revenues to investment barriers. The major decision-making factors were government policies, financial viability with and without revenue from the credits, and other barriers. Furthermore, since the carbon credits can be traded into cap and trade systems, the emission reductions must be additional. This study uses the barriers and decision-making factors to analyze the additionality of the CDM projects in comparison to the theory. The results found that while the additionality claims of the CDM projects were not false, in most cases the reasons cited would not likely have prevented the projects from being implemented. Implementation is more complex than the theory, and the next round of climate negotiations must take the difficulty ensuring strict environmental additionality into account.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0ec480440a364364cbc0545dcfb1a56d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Environment and Resource Policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ce182c58360a9a4a793f3e3107f868bd" level="item"><did><unittitle>One For All and All For One: Intra-Organizational Dynamics in Humanitarian Action</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Webster, Mackinnon</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_561fe119eadb66417273f969da3e038f">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: A significant proportion of humanitarian assistance is now delivered by NGOs which have in effect become federated transnational organizations--alliances of members from different countries--all seeking to provide assistance in times of crisis. This report describes research carried out to better understand how these transnational bodies organize their membership, deliver, and accountability systems in times of crisis. This report is the result of a study commissioned by Oxfam America. We examined the field response systems and structures of six NGOs to understand how they function during emergencies. A description of the organizations is included in the report. We identify six key learning points that are important for multi-member organizations operating in emergency contexts.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c56ea5cb1e87242f0740e7684c33355e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">International Organizations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ebfa32a126153cea8f7a149e38784617" level="item"><did><unittitle>Defining Corruption: A Comparison of the Substantive Criminal Law of Public Corruption in the United States and the United Kingdom</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Scally, Greg</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5ccbcabdc3539b896969db725b8ff102">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Though it is the FBI's highest criminal priority, there is no crime of 'public corruption' in the United States. Instead, acts we generally believe to constitute public corruption are criminalized in a broad array of overlapping statutes against acts such as bribery, extortion, and fraud. An ad hoc development of public corruption doctrine has resulted in a messy, confusing regime that remains full of open questions. This paper seeks to identify those questions and describe how they are dealt with in the United Kingdom. Part I will identify the toughest, most important open doctrinal questions in this field. Part II will describe the UK legal regime and compare it to existing American legal doctrine.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_732234d68e1994bd52db4eff18010e38"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c62b0ed3ad256b15636823859c83c5cf" level="item"><did><unittitle>Mobile Banking: Can Financial Services be Extended to Africa's Unbanked?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tschiemer, Robert A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e2d0864ef3ff4842310cb1b58ba50b05">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Beginning with an analysis of financial access barriers and market opportunities, four commercial mobile banking business models are analyzed in order to find out what their potential is for creating inclusive financial markets across Sub-Saharan Africa. By applying a comparative case study research design, the models are assessed with respect to their business strategy, market strategy, and the enabling business environment. The result is that all models are able to extend financial services to the unbanked, yet only to a limited extent so far. Services are dominated by payments and deposits, while microfinance loans are yet to be implemented. Among a range of environmental variables that may affect the replicability of business models, the business regulatory environment and legal rights of borrowers and lenders appear to clearly be the most important factors, followed by trade, while demographic and socioeconomic factors were deemed not to be significant.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c2e265d3f520d10783018c5f6f6ef6bd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">Law and Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9558635328f52d7a28ac629c41275914" level="item"><did><unittitle>When Do We Get to Peace?

Abstract: The research sought to understand some of the ranges of experiences of women and girls in post-conflict societies by examining the types, frequency, and nature of gender violence that women and girls experience in post-conflict Liberia. Given the nature and scale of sexual violence during the fourteen year civil conflict, what are the patterns of gender violence in post-conflict Liberia? Has sexual violence continued, and, if so, who is affected and how? Does the potential continuation of sexual violence reflect an attempt by men to reassert their authority and control over women and in society? Has there been an increase in domestic violence since the end of the war, and if so, is this in any way correlated with men pushing back on women and the public spaces and roles they filled in political, economic, and social life during the war? In light of post-conflict violence and poverty, what opportunities exist for women to mobilize in prevention and response to gender violence, and what barriers to justice exist for women and girls? Can we document any effective models for resistance to violence from the Liberian context? Given the frameworks that we have for understanding gender-based violence in conflict and post-conflict settings, this research seeks to understand what the reported violence in Liberia says about the aftermath of war for Liberian women and society in general. While this research was primarily exploratory in nature, I undertook it with a hypothesis that there has been an increase in domestic violence since the war ended, as has been documented in other post-conflict countries, and that women and communities may not have the access to services or criminal justice systems that they need in order to address the post-conflict violence. Additionally, because many Liberian women were extremely politically active in spearheading the Liberian peace movement and negotiations, I hypothesized that there would be tension around women's post-conflict social, economic, and political roles, which may cause violence between men and women at the inter-personal level.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_752087b6deb492a1be9c1d3b27283ad7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_712fcd14f083ff2dd498a0226a6acfe7" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Political Potential of Israel-GCC Business Relations</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00015</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shaham, Dahlia</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b7b322e11a3b822eeb3946f7dd78a9bc">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The economic discussion of the Arab-Israeli conflict and peace process has been governed over the years by two contradicting paradigms: the Arab Boycott and the vision of the New Middle East. Over the course of the past two decades both paradigms have been eroded. The Arab Boycott, which was once a comprehensive system of political and legal dams that hindered the flow of goods, services and information between Israel and the Arab world has been largely reduced to rubble by trade agreements and economic globalization. However, the alternative vision of a New Middle East in which peace agreements usher in unlimited economic cooperation and mounting peace dividends, has not materialized either. The first chapter of this paper explains the evolution of these paradigms. The paper then explores the reality of Israeli-Arab business relations and under the current conditions of continued Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It focuses on the special case of the GCC states, which are the richest and most globalized economies in the region. The second chapter outlines the history of Israeli-GCC relations; the third chapter exposes the reality of the officially non-existent Israel-GCC business relations - the sectors in which they are created and the bypass mechanisms used to facilitate them. Finally, the fourth chapter discusses the ways in which these business relations may affect the political reality of Arab-Israeli relations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_45578b2009af4482f447416a2f26d06c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">International Political Economy</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commercial Policies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_69977b1d55f7186335e0e6bde001096a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Profits, Planes and Policy: An Analysis of the Midway Airport Privatization and its Implications for Future Airport Privatizations in the United States</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00016</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cartmell, Sarah</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_107f0728119de6490915707cbcebf61a">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Midway International Airport in Chicago is poised to become the first large hub U.S. airport to be privatized through a 99-year lease and concession to the private sector. This precedent-setting airport privatization presents America's air transportation and infrastructure investment communities with a rich opportunity for discerning the immediate impact and broader implications of a domestic airport privatization. The Midway Airport privatization crests a confluence of forces that have made airport privatization an attractive and viable option for meeting the current and future needs of airports, and those of their public owners. America's aviation infrastructure requires far-reaching and expensive upgrades at a time when traditional airport financing modes are falling short. Further compounding this development are the mounting pressures on public budgets that serve to relegate infrastructure spending to a second-tier priority. At the same time, global infrastructure investors have amassed the money and trained their sights on transportation assets that provide steady cash flows. Both demand and supply line up to create an investment climate conducive to airport privatization. However, the theoretical arguments supporting and opposing airport privatization reveal a host of unresolved issues that serve to render airport privatization no panacea to the challenges facing the system. Instead, the theory and previous airport privatization experiences -- both domestic and international -- highlight the difficulty of undertaking a privatization and the inherent trade-offs involved. Most importantly, limited competition among airports makes efficiency gains under private ownership a questionable outcome. Against this backdrop, the Midway Airport privatization was structured and pursued to maximize upfront financial gain to the City of Chicago. This approach is problematic for several reasons: It reduced future revenue streams from the airport to the city; forced the city to incur ongoing financial obligations at Midway Airport that whittle down the amount netted from the transaction; and increased the risk of an overvaluation that will make it difficult for MIDCo to earn reasonable returns, thus ensuring precipitous price increases for airport users. While predicting the future financial and operational performance of a privatized Midway is difficult, the unresolved issues outlined above should give pause to other public airport owners considering airport privatization. The Midway International Airport privatization demonstrates that future airport privatizations in the United States should evolve beyond the narrow motive of immediate revenue generation to assume a structure that secures the diversion of long-term sustainable cash flows from the privatized airport and that provides for more competition and efficiency gains. Addendum: On April 20, 2009, the City of Chicago announced that the 99-year lease and concession of Midway Airport to MIDCo had collapsed. According to the city, MIDCo was unable to secure the financing necessary to make its $2.521 billion upfront payment to the city. Current city Chief Financial Officer Gene Saffold said the deal's collapse was attributable to the global economic crisis and liquidity crunch, which had severely impacted the availability of financing. Saffold also stated the city's intention to re-bid Midway Airport when market conditions improve.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5d1f1f9d7dd2854b8c790047c7a0bfca"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Business and Economic Law</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Political Economy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4c44ba6500e08a548d2e1e57b5733609" level="item"><did><unittitle>Tourism and Economic Development in Tanzania</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00017</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sitts, Sarah</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_75470481e398a3c2a403575ff8fc0650">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Tanzania is richly endowed in natural beauty, but most of its inhabitants are poor. Tourism presents an opportunity to capitalize on the world class concentrations of wildlife in the Northern Safari Circuit and the beautiful beaches of Zanzibar by generating income while sustaining the natural resources. This paper examines the ways in which the tourism industry contributes to economic development among Tanzanians. A value chain mapping approach to the two regions' tourism industries illustrates how much of the value is controlled by 'primary companies', hotels and, in the Northern Circuit, safari companies. Nine channels are identified through which tourism provides economic benefits to the poor, along with the channels' current limitations and the author's recommendations for enhancing their 'pro poor' outcomes. To consider the overall net benefits of tourism, the benefits are balanced by the negative social, environmental and economic impacts tourism has on Tanzanians. Key recommendations for enhancing the industry's overall economic development contributions are addressed to key players Ð primary businesses, the Tanzanian and Zanzibari governments, and international agencies Ð while recognizing the likely barriers to the policies' implementation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5626c4997e884da12437a5ba36d2c9e1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Political Economy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3524f2ab2891d2bfb1d108525ed2226b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Unraveling the Paradox: The Resilience of Women's Rights Activism in Iran within the Context of a Changing Political Environment</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00018</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Haeri, Medina</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_caca43048b2893b82d327e9df8099c3e">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This thesis proposes to unravel the paradox of women's rights activism in Iran through a critical examination of women's rights activities starting in the time of the Shah and continuing into the first twenty years of the Islamic Revolution. It will consider the reasons why women were not able to retain the legal rights they achieved during the Shah's regime, once the Islamic Republic emerged after the revolution. In contrast, despite the imposition of restrictive Islamic laws following the revolution, women's rights activism has continued to flourish and today, women have emerged as a deliberate and indigenous constituency in their own right. Unraveling the paradox means studying the factors and events that have shaped women's activism in Iran and realizing that despite changing political contexts and changing strategic tactics, the basic demands and desires of women in Iran have remained basically the same for the past forty years.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9f3ee1bbc5c490ae5c37f0fb441e9275"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2dd037b478266985080b5118cfe0ae93" level="item"><did><unittitle>The WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health: Will They Solve the Pharmaceutical Question?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.075.00019</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lima, Rafael Cavazzoni</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_94dc61f0cee20a44090014636d750e9e">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Laws in International Law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The Agreement in Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPs Agreement) transformed the standing of intellectual property in international law by incorporating into the legal framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) an improved system of standards for the protection of a full range of intellectual property (IP) rights, including copyrights,
patents, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets and geographical indications. This paper intends to offer the reader an analysis of the impact of the TRIPs agreement on the access to medicines in developing countries. More specifically, this dissertation aims to elucidate and explain the existing legal regime regulating the grant of compulsory licenses by developing countries for the implementation of domestic programs in the area of public health after the Doha Declaration. This legal examination will be followed by an interesting policy-oriented analysis. In this part of the paper, the cases of Rwanda, Brazil and Thailand will be properly addressed. The intention is to provide an opinion about the system that is currently in place and to analyze whether the Doha Declaration and
sequential actions were able to put an end to what was referred to as "The Pharmaceutical Question." Finally, the paper will offer a few ideas for making this system work better.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bff085f0929d2e058e500acd8d32ebf9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">LLM thesis</subject><subject source="local">Public Health</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject><subject source="local">Biotechnology</subject><subject source="local">Health policy</subject><subject source="local">Intellectual Property</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4f4b4ee1373f325437ce58e3e7863f51" level="item"><did><unittitle>Achieving universal health coverage in Mexico: The case of Seguro Popular</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Flores, Barbara E.

Abstract: To many a perceptive mind, the trade in E-Waste products should ideally be termed 'illegal' in view of the social hazards and moral shortcomings involved in exporting used, unreliable ICT equipment to developing countries, and consequently exposing marginalized workers to health hazards. But in the face of lax regulations imposed by E-Waste trading nations and only ad-hoc attempts made to curtail E-Waste trade, such is the magnitude of this unregulated waste flow, that it may actually be characterized in quantitative terms as 'free' trade, despite multilateral treaties which regulate trade in 'hazardous' products.  This thesis investigates through trade economics the assumption that the economic gains harvested by e-waste exchanging partners are welfare-enhancing enough that it becomes economically viable to condone the environmental and social costs borne by E-Waste receiving nations. In other words, this thesis explores whether E-Waste trade does in fact bring overall mutual economic gains to participating economies, thereby providing a logic behind lax regulation by governments.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c0f516f672fabf55cdd82ee398264a82"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commerce Policies</subject><subject source="local">Technology transfer</subject><subject source="local">Electronic waste</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5e403cb847ef5c3986051f23738d2ee8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Capstone Doctrine in Addressing UN Peacekeeping Challenges</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Christensen, Colin W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3ca7a192014c4de830092328253e04ce">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract: The United Nations originally developed the concept of peacekeeping and has far more experience with the practice than any other international or multi-lateral body. While it possesses substantial expertise in carrying out peacekeeping missions, it now faces a range of serious challenges to its capacity to continue doing so effectively. These challenges are not new, however, and in its long history with peacekeeping the UN has progressively evolved in its approach to the practice.  In January, 2008, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) approved the Capstone Doctrine (Capstone) as a way of helping to bring the lessons-learned of past peacekeeping operations under one conceptual roof (Capstone is officially titled the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, Principles and Guidelines).   In this paper I will examine the challenges faced by contemporary peacekeeping and look at how Capstone attempts to respond to these challenges. I conclude that Capstone addresses most, but not all of these challenges. In doing so, it presents a fundamentally conservative vision of peacekeeping, although it also leaves conceptual room open for some expansive interpretations of particular peacekeeping activities. I find that Capstone's direct impact is fairly limited to educational materials and as a potential reference tool for peacekeeping policymakers.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_942531b0e941795ceab95e31c23d0324"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Peace</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3808285f5849a5b08a59dc7384f85ede" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Responsibility to Protect:  Issues of Legal Formulation and Practical Application</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kantareva, Silva D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9b2d96bd679b7aee01838a95db9e9b65">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract:he codification of the doctrine of the 'responsibility to protect' at the World Summit meeting in 2005 is emblematic of the increasing importance attributed to human security in world affairs today. An indication of the growing recognition that state sovereignty 'finds limits in the protection of human security,' the responsibility to protect, also known as R2P, posits an alternative interpretation of sovereignty-one that is no longer just a right in Westphalian terms, but one that also creates obligations for States with respect to the security of their subjects.  As a doctrine, R2P encompasses a number of normative tenets with varying degrees of legal acceptance, the most controversial of which seeks to permit coercive intervention, under certain conditions. Given the wide and long-standing acceptance for the preventive and peace-building aspects of the doctrine, the real debate surrounding R2P is a rehash of the long-standing discussion on 'just war' and humanitarian intervention. While far from crystallizing into anything resembling binding law, R2P can arguably impact the justificatory discourse  in international law and raise the political costs of action or inaction in the face of gross human rights violations.  By creating a sense of moral obligation among States, through a repeated process of interaction, interpretation and internalization,  R2P has the potential to spur a 'coincidence of interest.' With this paper, I will examine whether it is justified to speak of an emerging norm in the case of R2P; whether state practice in the area demonstrates any conformity to this principle; and whether there is any evidence in international discourse of a broad consensus (opinio juris) with respect to its legality.  In order to judge the potential for such an outcome to develop, a useful starting point would be to track the frequency and nature of recourse to this concept in international discourse, and more specifically, within the General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council, which, insofar as coercive action is concerned, has been officially charged with the responsibility to protect. Five years into its official 'endorsement,' the responsibility to protect has been barely made operational and has done very little by way of affecting discourse among Member States.  The Security Council is yet to translate R2P in a meaningful way even though it has had ample opportunities to invoke R2P, in the cases of Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Somalia or Myanmar. It certainly failed to operationalize it in the cases of Darfur and the DRC. What is more, there seems to be little agreement among the membership as to the scope and operational parameters of R2P, as becomes obvious from recent debates in the General Assembly.  The conduct and statements of States do not give weight to the idea that humanitarian intervention, albeit under a different nomenclature, is now legal or justified by this nascent doctrine.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e08106d84b193b59b35ac27c47512800"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e2d12c3edfe06790e33e059f2736cbf3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Judicial Reform in Afghanistan: Towards a Holistic Understanding of Legitimacy in Post-Conflict Societies</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Christensen, Maren I.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d97ee631c6bd1a44171deb41b5b25756">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract: This investigation seeks to elucidate the connections among three aspects of rule of law through an examination of judicial reform in post-Taliban Afghanistan.  I hypothesize that building judicial independence, engagement with customary law, and anti-corruption efforts, usually approached separately, are interdependent through their impacts on legitimacy.  Failings in post-2001 Afghanistan, particularly the insistence on building rule of law from the top-down, have resulted in a formal judiciary that is neither independent, nor accountable, nor culturally viable.  Taking note of the way in which these failings are being harnessed by the insurgency to further divide the nation as a whole and prevent the state from building legitimacy, the theoretical hypothesis is supported: effectiveness and appeal to tradition are necessary conditions for building legitimacy.  These conditions are satisfied, respectively, through (1) successful anti-corruption and independent, sustainable institution building, and (2) consultation and genuine engagement with all sources of traditional authority.   Having come to an understanding of the importance of bottom-up and top-down rule of law, I recommend that while we sustain our efforts in anti-corruption and institution building in the formal sector, we also need direct engagement that is community-specific: bringing together traditional leaders, local state justice officials, and progressive stakeholders such as women's rights advocates to come to a better understanding of each other's intentions, priorities, practices and values. This kind of dialogue would build non-coercive consensus on an arrangement that covers all bases in the administration of justice between the courts and informal jirgas or shuras.  Once a number of these groups have been successful, there will be stronger impetus to replicate this dialogue at the national level, bridging top-down institution building and legal development with bottom-up social transformation.  Such a holistic approach would garner state legitimacy in a way that is simultaneously modern, effective, and genuinely Afghan.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6c5821ae11e0a7542bb069fc689c5eeb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Rule of law</subject><subject source="local">Nation-building</subject><subject source="local">Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis</subject><subject source="local">Postwar reconstruction</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_69d50d15545955d2a213433f4a1399e1" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Lifecourse Perspective of Intimate Partner Violence in India: What Picture Does the NFHS-3 Paint?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Heilman, Brian P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e6bc025193433a748426d4b3cc956189">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract: The third National Family Health Survey of India has provided India with its first ever nationally representative data on domestic violence against women. This paper applies a lifecourse perspective to that data in order to understand how and when the major risk factors for intimate partner violence enter the lives of Indian women. Based on survey data, it finds that a preponderance of strong risk factors enter a woman's life very early. These factors include: childhood experience of violence, woman's justification of violence, husband's alcohol use, and husband's controlling behavior. The paper also uses a series of nonlinear probit regressions to compare the relative strength of the risk factors presented by the survey data. Holding the findings of its lifecourse perspective and regression equations against a relevant literature review, the paper concludes that the "picture" of intimate partner violence presented by this new survey data is improved but incomplete. Most critically, the lifecourse perspective presented in this paper highlights the fact that the survey fails to account adequately for major transitions in the life of a woman. These transitions include adolescence and the movement from "young bride" to "mother-in-law" status. The paper provides concrete suggestions for how a more nuanced attention the changing dynamics of life stages in the Indian woman's life can increase the value and accuracy of "pictures" of violence produced by future versions of the National Family Health Survey.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9cddf4657b466702dae434226dd65cda"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Family violence</subject><subject source="local">Abused women</subject><subject source="local">Health surveys</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7177383c9c7ca59e37f2a735a475d1ca" level="item"><did><unittitle>Biofuels and its Implications on Food Security, Climate Change, and Energy Security: A Case Study of Nepal</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pradhan, Shailee</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_17aa1f203f6d34b530dd77c13d5911b4">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract: Some of the biggest challenges the world is facing today are climate change and energy insecurity. The production of biofuels raised hopes around the world as a solution to mitigate climate change and ensure energy security. The debate on whether biofuels fulfill such promises is both active and evolving; with links being drawn between the global food crisis of 2008 and biofuel production, the discourse has taken a different turn.   The fact is biofuels are not the sole cause of the global food crisis. The rising food prices were also a result of 1) reduction of production capacity in developing countries, 2) population and income growth in emerging economies and associated dietary changes, 3) the surge in oil prices in 2008, which drove up prices of fertilizers and fuels, and 4) unfavorable weather in key producing countries, among others (ADB, 2008; Timmer, 2008).  Without access to energy, production capacity in developing countries is bound to remain stagnant, if not fall even further, as the availability of agricultural land is not increasing. Secondly, population growth in emerging economies will put further pressure on energy security and energy demand will increase. Thirdly, as oil prices rise, food prices will rise. Fourthly, the current pace of emissions could multiply destructive climate events, negatively affecting crop yields and thus increasing food prices further. Hence, if energy security, environment, and employment generation are sacrificed at the cost of saving food security, we may not be helping food security in the long run.  The trade-offs are also country-specific. For a country that has a large segment of its population living in extreme poverty, food security remains one of the top priorities. However, if that country is also seriously energy insecure, especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and has stagnant agricultural productivity, then the question of trade-offs becomes even more difficult to answer. This is the case of Nepal, a developing country in South Asia, a region particularly vulnerable to climate change. In developing countries, the need still remains in providing affordable, reliable, and accessible energy through diverse sources. It is critical for developing countries to diversify their fuel options such as kerosene, biogas, solar, and electricity for household sector and liquid biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel in the transport sector.   Biofuels can play an important role in supplying energy in rural sector without negatively affecting food security and the environment. The key is to distinguish between large-scale biofuel production that diverts water, labor, land, and food crops like maize and sugarcane away from food to fuel and small to medium-scale local biofuel production for local energy needs using non-food crops, marginalized land, and underutilized labor.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d4c4e11373303902ebd5b0127754ff06"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Natural resources</subject><subject source="local">Biomass energy</subject><subject source="local">Land use</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f17af652b40fec3fd07234f442ce89d8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Global Trends in Demobilizing Guerilla Movements: Lebanese Hizballah, FMLN in El Salvador, and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, 1989-2009</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Adams, Brooke A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010" type="inclusive">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6178d363739eb587c33e8f21273fbade">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract: This paper examines the methods by which guerilla organizations are demobilized and converted into political parties through inclusion in post-conflict political processes. With the use of three case studies of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), Sudanese People's Liberation Army / Movement (SPLM/A), and Lebanese Hizballah, this paper examines these movements on a spectrum from most to least successfully converted into mainstream political organizations. In order to do so this paper considers participation in democratic elections, along with the completeness of disarmament. Secondly, this paper assesses the role of the United Nations in establishing peace agreements in such conflicts, and its ability to enforce the criteria for political inclusiveness called for in the negotiated peace settlements. Finally, this paper discusses possibilities for future disarmament of political-guerilla organizations by examining the case of Hizballah.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3797c3a91dde0ed4649a287c63f2a579"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Postwar reconstruction</subject><subject source="local">Guerrillas.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_eadb5812efba7467d2df7ebcd8c316fa" level="item"><did><unittitle>Inadequate Institutions and Inefficient Outcomes in Mexico's Sugar Industry</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Scaife, Katherine M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c52835ce814965fe1142fa5baad374ad">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract: Institutions can encourage market development and economic growth by creating incentives for individuals to invest in productivity.  When institutions fail to create incentives, or create incentives for individuals to make poor production decisions, development objectives may suffer as a result.  In this thesis, I argue that dysfunctional formal and informal institutions weaken the incentives to invest in sugarcane for Mexican farmers and sugar mill owners; furthermore, that these institutional weaknesses, and not trade liberalization, cause low-quality sugarcane and inefficient sugar production.  Land tenure institutions create incentives for farmers to continue producing on small plots of land while sugarcane farmer associations fail to coordinate farmers' investment and cultivation decisions.  Industry pricing regulations weaken farmers' incentives to improve their sugarcane stock.  A history of government expropriation of sugar mills unexpectedly creates incentives for owners to invest more in mills than in increasing field productivity.  Increasing migration from sugarcane-producing regions and land consolidation efforts by Mexican sugar mills suggest that current inefficient production standards may soon change.  Institutional reforms would speed up this process while also seeking to improve farmer welfare during the transition.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1c1854667073b255246a042eb6506c23"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commerce Policies</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject><subject source="local">Land use</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_79ef3c53a2f0f64a821bd057ef05706f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Savings Institutions - Savings Culture:  The effect of culture and institutions on financial behaviors</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Leung, Tara A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_31b1bad295cb487aa22be0e9152758dc">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract: How does culture influence how people manage money?   In order to continue to provide better financial services for the poor, microfinance must recognize how the poor already manage their money and why they choose the strategies they do.  To that end, this paper explores what role culture plays in determining financial behavior, and how a greater understanding of that role may help microfinance institutions (MFIs) provide better financial services to the rural poor.  This paper is the result of financial diaries research in Rivas, Nicaragua, in 2009 as a consultancy project for international development agency Agros International .  The study was designed to capture what financial services, both formal and informal, beneficiaries in their program sites used and why.  Study data showed that respondents used many financial services, except for savings, a phenomenon that participants claimed was cultural.  Subsequent research around culture and financial behavior revealed that culture can affect financial behaviors, but that its impacts are diluted and often indistinguishable from those of institutions and history.  Since institutions are more flexible than culture or history, they should be the primary means by which MFIs and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) encourage better financial management among the poor.   The microfinance industry is urged to consider cultural factors in terms of individuals' beliefs about how to win in their, in order to gain a deeper understanding of a community's needs and the possible usefulness or harm of changing an institution or introducing a new microfinance product.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_de8f0314ce6d4bbcbf275e6b9d7a715e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Microfinance.</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Finance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f8948027102285384d74779a8a1cf9cb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Disaggregating the Displaced: The Influence of Refugee Contexts and Origins on Militarization and State Security</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Allen, Stephen A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8b2fe59e0a34251c6b1b1f199770a474">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract:  As states continue to restrict asylum rights offered to refugees on the basis of national security, it is important to examine the actual security implications posed by refugees.  This thesis presents the literature explaining why refugees are viewed as security threats, and then argues that most refugees are not a threat.  The literature on refugees and security conflates some refugees with all refugees, which excuses states for approaching displacement crises with a security-first attitude.  I argue that by disaggregating refugee populations based on their contexts and origins, policy makers can more accurately examine refugee militarization and determine whether or not it is likely to be a threat.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e6ff4110bd7e55e5d0f55b2bd6393a67"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8f6b62fca5e27ef10d678303d520b615" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Fog of Peace: Comparing U.S. and UN Approaches to Conflict Management in Nepal</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gross, Joshua R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1f93ef59eb88643024c65386a531b9d6">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract:  An engagement strategy-employed to change an adversary's perception of its self-interest while proposing attractive alternatives to its current course of action-has been the rationale behind numerous UN-led mediation efforts with non-state armed groups. Traditionally, the UN has talked to groups that are considered terrorists by the U.S. Alternatively, the U.S. rarely chooses to overtly engage armed groups. In the aftermath of Nepal's ten-year civil war, U.S. and UN approaches to conflict management were defined by a fundamental disagreement over the efficacy of engagement with the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The Maoists have been a specially designated terrorist entity by the U.S. since 2003.  Neither the U.S.' non-recognition strategy nor the U.N.'s engagement strategy succeeded in changing the Maoists' intentions, capabilities or behavior. The mindset of counter-terrorism impeded the U.S.' ability to contextually analyze the likelihood that the Maoists could moderate and evolve into a legitimate political party. The Maoists' terrorist designation was the primary obstacle that prevented the U.S. from playing a more constructive role in Nepal's peace process. Labeling a group a terrorist entity and cutting off the possibility for engagement can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, neutralizing incentives for an armed group to undergo the difficult transformation into a legitimate and nonviolent political party.  Alternatively, the United Nations pursued a strategy of inducement and socialization, but failed to appropriately respond to Maoist actions that contravened the letter and the spirit of the peace process. The United Nations Mission in Nepal was established as a political mission with a narrow mandate, lacking both armed peacekeepers and the power to act as an official mediator. The UN's approach to conflict management in Nepal suggests that they did not anticipate the possibility that the Maoists had entered into negotiations in bad faith.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d9cdcdb1b0b2cf2455ea1b6458cd86fc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_99de3465970f42df28da96dd49570647" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Dawn of a New Arctic Chessboard</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Deheza, Elizabeth</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3c2516edaf39c63439fc7047471ffd4d">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract:  The Arctic region is constantly changing and over the past decade has been re-launched to the forefront of modern geopolitics as climate change has increased the potential availability of natural resources and new shipping lanes. This has sparked the interest not only of the five polar coastal states (U.S., Russia, Canada, Norway and Denmark (Greenland)) and the Arctic Council; but also of other countries and non-state actors who wish to exert their influence on the region. Elevated interest in the area and the desire of outside actors to become involved, have the potential to completely alter the political dynamics of decision making processes. We demonstrate and quantify, by analysis of geopolitical and international relations theories, motivations of the main actors, and the development of a Chessboard Model based on game theory, that it is imperative for the polar coastal states to resolve their existing disputes and collaborate in the region if they are to discourage the involvement of Arctic "newcomers" and retain control of decision making processes in the Arctic.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3f1ccdb6b917f0fd8ed178b198a8fc55"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Climate Change</subject><subject source="local">Natural resources</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4e238270af2b18d5e54564f8e8c8fa3e" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Real Great Leap Forward: History, Drivers And Expected Trends Of M&amp;A In The People's Republic Of China</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Sabet d'Acre, Constantin</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b9e787bad4711bf71c13462586bf96e0">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Abstract: Since 1978 and China's opening to the world, M&amp;A in China, just as the country's economy, has gone a long way. This thesis intends to understand what were the drivers that led to such growth in M&amp;A in China? In addition, it will analyze what were the trends in M&amp;A that resulted from these drivers? Finally, it will try to answer the question of what can we say about future trends in M&amp;A in China in light of our knowledge of these historical drivers and trends?  With the beginning of the reform and open-up policy in 1978, China progressively opened its economy to sweeping changes. This led to many distortions which put SOEs in difficult situations. Government sponsored M&amp;A transactions to rescue failing enterprises appeared. All in all, in between 1978 and 1991, M&amp;As in China made their first steps.  China's reform program found a new life after 1992. A well-needed legal framework started to appear concerning company law in general, but also clarifying certain issues on M&amp;A. However, this framework remained rather unclear and complex. Most domestic transactions were still government orchestrated 'bail-out' of failing firms. Total inbound M&amp;A value over the period increased in size thanks to the improved regulatory environment, and certain important patterns appeared. Finally, outbound M&amp;A remained inconsequential until 2001.  Since 2001, and China's WTO entry, M&amp;As in China have greatly changed. Total values of domestic, inbound and outbound M&amp;As have increased substantially. Inbound M&amp;As have benefitted from the opening of the economy and decreased government restrictions. Domestic M&amp;As have grown both thanks to increased M&amp;A led by private companies and industry consolidation led by SOEs. Similarly, outbound M&amp;As have been led by both private and public companies that are looking abroad for growth and technology. However, in all these cases, the government's role is still very existent.  When looking at the future, it is likely that government involvement will not disappear. While it is reasonable to expect growth in inbound M&amp;A, this growth will still be bound by the government's interests. With regards to domestic and outbound M&amp;A, private companies will progressively become responsible for more deals of a larger scale as they grow in size, but M&amp;As led by SOEs will not disappear from the picture either if the government's policies do not change too much when the new leadership takes power in 2012.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3de8089ec93d8134c86b0305b21501da"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Finance</subject><subject source="local">Economic policy</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_07cbcd4f5a2904b28725e6abbf53c84a" level="item"><did><unittitle>From the Desert to the Sea: The Maritime Jurisdiction of an Independent Western Sahara</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00015</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, Jeffrey J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_eff9c4af367a06bcd3ab11900108cfca">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Laws in International Law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Western Sahara is the last colonial territory in Africa. Its people have been unable to realize their right of self-determination since the former colonial power, Spain, ceded the territory to Mauritania and Morocco in 1975. The presumptive maritime or ocean jurisdiction of an independent Western Sahara, formally known as the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (the SADR), is examined. The analysis begins with the history of the territory's creation, the establishment of its land boundaries in the colonial era and its natural resources. The events relating to the territory's stalled decolonization are then canvassed. The current maritime jurisdictional claims of States in the Saharan Atlantic region are considered, together with continuing fisheries uses in Saharan waters, as well as the results of the 2009 enactment of the author's ocean jurisdiction legislation for the SADR. The law of maritime delimitation, which includes the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, decisions of the International Court of Justice and other tribunals, and state practice, is reviewed and applied to determine the likely or probable maritime jurisdiction of the SADR, including its territorial sea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. Issues concerning a possible claim to the extended continental shelf are addressed. Conclusions about maritime jurisdictional areas (or zones) are given in a series of purpose-drawn maps showing the SADR's likely maritime boundaries. The possibility of the SADR acceding to the Law of the Sea Convention is then addressed in the context of remedial measures to restrain the taking of ocean resources from the maritime area of the territory pending resolution of the "question" of Western Sahara and the exercise by its people of their right of self determination.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f8e475c6fe9345cfd78dad4e252b860d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">LLM thesis</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject><subject source="local">Maritime law</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5dc4778327a9890acedc8d257b57d4d0" level="item"><did><unittitle>Central Bank Independence in an African Context: the Case of Zambia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00016</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chinyanta, N.

Abstract: This paper examines the importance of central banks and the argument made for their independence, especially in developing countries. The subject is deemed topical in view of the prevailing economic crisis and the reaction of governments and central banks. Utilizing a historical analysis of how the concept and legal frameworks have evolved in England, the United States, the European Community, China and some African countries, the paper then focuses on the case study of Zambia to study the implications and impact. Interestingly the paper's findings are that CBI matters in developing countries not only for the monetary arguments made in more developed economies, but as a preemptive mechanism for defending public assets, as well as a best practice tool  for transparency (and therefore lessening corruption) in the public sector. In Zambia's case specifically, it is found that CBI is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for stability in the financial sector and therefore critical to the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment, whilst providing for a more transparent and accountable framework for Official Development Assistance.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4cd05c18da10186146fee17c5abbf9fe"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">LLM thesis</subject><subject source="local">Banks and banking, Central</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Law and Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_259fd82a8ce520342c2d6c66acf5e831" level="item"><did><unittitle>Non-Agricultural Fair Trade: An Analysis of Economic and Developmental Benefits and Challenges</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00017</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Trackman, Louisa C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_788563b69768f3ce625c843048586ee7">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Fair trade has experienced significant growth in the past decade, particularly in the agricultural sector. An expanding body of literature analyzing fair trade reflects this growth; however, this literature overwhelmingly ignores non-agricultural fair trade, despite the fact that it makes up a quarter of the fair trade industry. The primary argument of this paper is that the failure to acknowledge or distinguish non-agricultural fair trade from agricultural fair trade results in an incomplete analysis of the benefits and challenges of fair trade because non-agricultural fair trade is characterized by several important features that differentiate it from agricultural fair trade. Some of these differences arise from institutional variations in strategy and structure, while others are a function of the agricultural and non-agricultural markets. These strategic and structural differences are outlined in Section 1, while the market differences are addressed in Sections 2 and 3. Although there is an abundance of literature regarding the benefits of fair trade, there is almost no analysis of fair trade's intended benefits using economic theory. Section 2 develops the economic theory behind the benefits of fair trade and applies this analysis, as well as the developmental benefits of fair trade identified in the literature, to both agricultural and non-agricultural fair trade. In addition it identifies benefits that are particular to non-agricultural fair trade. Section 3 utilizes the existing body of literature on the economic and development challenges of agricultural fair trade as an initial framework and discusses the applicability of these features to non-agricultural fair trade. It also identifies additional challenges that non-agricultural fair trade faces. Sections 2 and 3 demonstrate that not only is fair trade a useful tool for poverty reduction, but non-agricultural fair trade and agricultural fair trade should not mistaken for being the same tool due to differences in the demographics of the population that they reach as well as differences in the supply chain and product design, quality, and uniformity. Section 4 discusses the incomplete analysis regarding the effectiveness of fair trade as compared to other development interventions and the necessary steps and associated challenges of evaluating fair trade programs.  This paper concludes that although agricultural and non-agricultural fair trade have the similar underlying goal of improving the livelihood security and well-being of economically disadvantaged producers in developing countries, as a result of the differing strategies and markets, these two varieties of fair trade function differently, affect different populations, and analysis of one should not be assumed to apply to the other.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_60c0abf40efc8494397189bc6746b1dc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_01acec24c29096593eb60e54c88bb492" level="item"><did><unittitle>Militias as sociopolitical movements: Iraq's armed Shia groups</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00018</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Thurber, Richard Chesley</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1ed7a066f64e7056d461636cdc8890b1">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The rise to power of Iraq's Shia militias not only caught U.S. policymakers off-guard, it also revealed a broader lack of understanding of militias as a type of non-state armed group.  While considerable research has been conducted on terrorist networks and insurgencies, the literature on militias is relatively weak. Furthermore, the Iraq case suggests that the frameworks that do exist for analyzing militias need to be expanded. Through a review of the existing literature on militias followed by a case study of the two largest Shia militias in Iraq - the Badr Organization and the Mahdi Army - this paper seeks to differentiate the Iraqi groups from previous characterizations of the militia based on their degree of popular legitimacy, pursuit of a social and political agenda, and participation in the institutions of the state. Far more than just warlords, Iraq's Shia militias are complex sociopolitical movements who are actively seeking to fill the gaps left by the weakness of the state in a bid to win the support of the people and consequently gain political influence. The use of force is but one element, along with the provision of social services and participation in formal politics, that these groups use as instruments to gain influence and realize their social and political agendas.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cdef9424e1273b803ee4805b79e0f2c0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Militia movements</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1b6ae7bd0d1d2f5e44e7d4cb49cb3290" level="item"><did><unittitle>A dissappearing right of self-determination: The ongoing impasse in Western Sahara and its consequences</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00020</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lewis, Andrew G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_58a814664c0f420ae1465618977ee2c5">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The international law of self-determination and decolonization only provides a basic framework to guide the general outlines of what a resolution to the dispute over Western Sahara might look like, but the law is too weak to point to a specific and definitive solution. The expectation that the law should provide the basis for a resolution may be unrealistic. This expectation may in part be based on how references to principles of self-determination have been made throughout the course of the dispute. The failure to resolve the dispute after 34 years is in part explained by the weakness of the international law in this arena, and in part by how it has been sporadically and inconsistently applied. Even if the UN Security Council, tasked with resolving the dispute, wanted to use international law as the only basis for a resolution, it would struggle. However, the Security Council has further confused the issue by paying lip service to decolonization and self-determination throughout its handling of the 34-year dispute, and claiming to act in accordance with international legal principles. Yet when faced with opportunities to act decisively to resolve the dispute in accordance with these principles, the Council has allowed politics to trump international law, even ignoring its own resolutions in the process. Its inconsistent behavior has had the effect of further weakening the usefulness of the international law of self-determination. Any future action taken towards a resolution must be read as being based on political agreement, rather than acceptance on the part of Council members of any international legal principles.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b2a90d53ab4c7d6faca300bba45e7d56"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Decolonization</subject><subject source="local">Self-determination, national</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3d6352060db5e1097f50fd8d8b44001a" level="item"><did><unittitle>How multilateral environmental regimes affect policies for forest conservation and ecosystem services provision: The case of Costa Rica</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.077.00021</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Muñoz Brenes, Carlos Luis</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_400c776ddf86e0263495142a42959ab5">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Costa Rica's success in promoting conservation policies has emanated from a strategic reading and adaptive capacity to multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) in combination with the collective action between the state and major actors in civil society and across the border. A strategic reading implies institutional changes from collective action and adaptability to feedbacks from the agents in the social and ecological systems. The policymaking process had a strong reaction to the international environmental agreement negotiations. Policies established from the 1970s to 1996 had ambiguous effects on development. There is clear evidence that forest conservation policies and institutional changes in the late 1980s were influenced by international agreements. Such changes fostered a development path that closely resembles the notion of sustainability; forest ecosystems services contribute to ecotourism, agriculture, energy sectors, and improvement of people's livelihoods. Further, national policy innovation had a spillover effect at the international level. Externally, actors in the global domain saw the Costa Rican experience as replicable or adaptable to other social and economic contexts, the international climate change agenda provides a fertile ground to experiment on how MEAs contribute to changes in domestic policy and how these regimes can also be influenced by successful policies. The REDD negotiations provide strong evidence that supports the idea of the emergence of a global ecosystem service regime which allows public, private, and international transaction to take place around ecosystem services. Such regime may also help give coherence to a global system of environmental governance.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_90924fce7d4ff85c986f3d33f2a02063"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Sustainability and the environment</subject><subject source="local">Ecotourism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_167f64ede17af499aad19716cd74af6b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Prospects for Global Environmental Accountability Bodies: Assessing the Suitability of the UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies Model for International Environmental Treaty Governance</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ratcliff, Blake L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d9fd998c9725791b3b8cfc93771277db">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: With hundreds of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) currently in force, and countless others operating on a regional or bilateral basis, the decentralized system of international environmental governance is clogged with vague treaty provisions and uncoordinated and overlapping subject matter treatment that reduce treaty effectiveness.  The current tools to monitor and promote compliance with MEA obligations are uneven, mostly non-binding, and ineffective in their efforts to coordinate their treaties and maximize active implementation.  This research paper explores whether the UN human rights treaty bodies model, a method that has been used successfully in international human rights law for decades to urge treaty implementation and advance norms, is a framework that can be adapted and effectively employed in the framework of international environmental governance to accomplish the same goals.  The treaty bodies model encompasses a system of mandatory periodic state reporting that centers on a constructive dialogue with an independent expert committee, general comments, and the adjudication of individual complaints.  By exploring the development of human rights and international environmental governance, and the links between the two disciplines, this paper argues that the creation of global environmental accountability bodies, committees modeled closely after the human rights treaty bodies but tailored for international environmental regimes, can bring about effective and active treaty implementation and increased levels of compliance if challenges to their creation can be overcome.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_dfd789b4e13f5a1970b5736de79b276a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Environment and Resource Policy</subject><subject source="local">International environmental governance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c3a41bd4b6f83e8d539d351fbaaa4b12" level="item"><did><unittitle>Bottling renewable energy: market assessment of grid-scale storage for renewable intergration in the U.S.</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Manghani, Ravi Ashokkumar</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_91c995fe0856261034de3037510158be">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Grid-scale energy storage has received considerable attention in the recent years and global revenues are projected to increase from $1.5 billion in 2010 to $35.3 billion by 2020. In the U.S., energy storage finds multiple applications, driven by Renewable Integration, Peak Load Growth, Transmission Constraints and Smart Grid. More renewable energy resources on the grid offer hand-in-glove opportunities for storage due to variable nature of renewable generation, which further burdens already inefficient grid operations. However, storage industry faces technical, economic and regulatory barriers, which will have to be overcome to encourage large-scale adoption. This paper reviews the market opportunities, discusses the economics and barriers, and provides prescriptions for possible business models and policy recommendations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_95ce739a94c48a7cb76dfd2cf9a1b956"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Energy policy</subject><subject source="local">Renewable energy sources</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_da8bbd444cd3951507bfb26c5155134a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Bridging the void: social media's potential to transform intergroup relations in fractured societies</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Elise S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_588114c32d29974c3e7b43883e9419f3">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: When physical contact between divergent groups is either impossible or socially unacceptable, mainstream media may exacerbate stereotypes of "the other" and detract from any progress toward intergroup reconciliation. In this context, certain social media tools seem poised to positively influence social processes. Here I examine the potential for moderated discussion fora to improve intergroup relations, particularly in post-conflict societies afflicted by an intergroup contact void. I apply tenets of conflict resolution literature and technology theory to measure attitude transformation in a case study of Caucasus Edition, a fully moderated website dedicated to generating discussion on the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process. The site invites participants (primarily Armenians and Azerbaijanis) to post original content and to comment on postings. Its key attribute is arguably the sense of trust fostered through strong moderation; vitriol and ad hominen attacks are not tolerated. Although it is difficult to satisfactorily measure attitude transformation, and social media are no silver bullet, such moderated websites may be capable of eroding enduring stereotypes and exposing human commonalities to help transcend monolithic perceptions of "the other."</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_48529d1ea103d873e59b45ad48f06659"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Social Networks</subject><subject source="local">Social media</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_41dd9240efc2912d95c560abb28856e3" level="item"><did><unittitle>A state of inequality: confronting elite capture in post-conflict Guatemala</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stine, Kelsi R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_06dcddc2402150902467ca8887111517">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: State capture is a type of corruption that deserves more attention in the international policy sphere. This thesis analyzes how Guatemala's oligarchy captures public decision making processes in order to shed light on how the international community can more proactively address state capture. It first provides a contextual overview of corruption and state capture, arguing that corruption is an inherently political and highly contextual concept. Guatemala is used as the primary focus of analysis because its history of Spanish colonialism, marginalization of indigenous communities, repressive military governance, and economic monopolization has created an environment of extreme state capture. The main case study illuminates how Guatemala's oligarchy succeeded in keeping land reform out of the 1996 peace process as an example of how other state processes in the post-conflict period are similarly captured. Ultimately, efforts to address state capture have to be political in order to work; the current system of providing international technical assistance is ineffective. However, political solutions to state capture remain generally untested, and require accurate state capture diagnosis, further research, and gradual implementation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1da490a925ad9c88646db5c9ffac6679"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Political corruption</subject><subject source="local">Oligarchy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f34750e78bd3e5d961b0113ab63e1c3a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Effects of teacher characteristics on Project ABC outcomes in Niger</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Schutte, Rebecca F.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f61dae63406d53530de4248c4e1b096d">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper provides the results of an impact evaluation measuring the effect of observable teacher characteristics (gender, age, local status and years of schooling) on Project ABC outcomes. Project ABC is a randomized mobile phone adult education program which taught participants basic mobile phone skills along with traditional literacy and math classes in two regions of Niger. Female teachers were associated with lower test scores overall, although this is highly correlated with the fact that female teachers mostly taught female students who had lower scores than males, on average. For teacher age, we see that younger teachers are better at teaching technology (target age for teachers is 28 to 33 years old) in ABC literacy classes, whereas older teachers (target age is 37 to 45 years old) are better at teaching ABC math which uses more traditional methods. Local teachers (teachers from the village where they were teaching) have a positive effect on ABC scores in Dosso, but a negative effect in Dosso overall and in Zinder. Teachers should have at least 7 years of schooling in order to have the greatest impact on student test scores.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2c63ad168db2a4f46722afe390bc79f0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Teaching</subject><subject source="local">Education</subject><subject source="local">Teacher-student relationships</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8d9b4c0425d167d6a75ec0035253099d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Securitization of real estate receivables in Brazil</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tabacniks, Erika M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011" type="inclusive">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_08f16df3118bd0b31534c46cf5d48f16">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The implementation of a securitization system that could be used as an efficient way of financing the real estate market in Brazil depends on the existence of three main items: a favorable macroeconomic environment; a comprehensive and effective legal and regulatory framework that brings security to investors; and a broad market with investor appetite for different types of investments. These three factors are currently present in the Brazilian market and securitization of real estate receivables seems to be a promising source of funding.&#13;
However, its expansion is subject to the rules imposed by the government on the market and in the economy, which can create incentives to attract investors or not. Despite the existence of the three items above in the Brazilian market and the recent developments in securitization and government efforts to enhance long-term funding options, it will still lag behind in 2011. There are important hurdles facing this segment in Brazil, such as the high interest rates that have haunted the economy for decades and other technical and structural problems.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5dc63993456face79e3b95cbd6f114b4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Economic Reforms</subject><subject source="local">Real estate development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b2467c877357833bdc3a403306e53310" level="item"><did><unittitle>The centre cannot hold: impact of the scientific and information revolutions on the nonproliferation regime</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Moodie, Amanda R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_900eae64a49df56256fdb1f4b767393d">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The basic assumption of the nonproliferation regime "that proliferation can be limited by controlling access to materials and equipment as well as securing sensitive information and data" is increasingly erroneous. What people know is becoming more critical to whether they develop a chemical, biological, or nuclear capability than what they possess. The materials and equipment necessary for proliferation are now more readily available than ever before; therefore, access to equipment, particularly with regards to chemical and biological weapons, is no longer the main barrier to proliferation. At the same time, the scientific expertise necessary to develop such a weapon is far more common and readily available than it has been at any point in the past. The shifts and developments in science and technology demand a new framework for conceptualizing proliferation risks and formulating policy, one that de-emphasizes control of materials or so-called "sensitive" information, and instead emphasizes the will or lack thereof of states or other actors to develop weapons of mass destruction and focuses on how to shape choices regarding proliferation. This paper will examine the assumptions and thinking of the traditional nonproliferation regime, as well as the ways in which the scientific advances and the information revolution of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries might undermine these assumptions. It suggests that there needs to be a corresponding shift in the way that policymakers and scholars think about proliferation and the means of preventing it, in order to address these new challenges effectively.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3a7683ecddca9e265ff1abef65fd4980"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Weapons of mass destruction</subject><subject source="local">Biological weapons</subject><subject source="local">Chemical weapons</subject><subject source="local">Arms race</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7e4914ec0039e53405569ff449b0499c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Mozambique and the Mozal Aluminum Project: perils of megaproject-led economic development</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wood, Colin H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_31488c394a974ab42f755125a19fc2d7">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Macroeconomic trends and micro-level econometric impact evaluation analysis of Mozambique's industrialization strategy reveal the potential perils of 'megaproject'-led growth.  Beginning in the early 1990s, Mozambique adopted a wide range of economic policy reforms advocated by the multilateral donor community under the umbrella of the Washington Consensus and with a particular emphasis on large industrial projects.  The $1.4 billion Mozal aluminum smelter kickstarted this approach in 2000, when the country's GDP was $1.7 billion.  Mozambique subsequently attracted large amounts of foreign investment in the form of megaprojects, which served to offset a long history of external imbalances.  While these projects improved Mozambique's balance of payments, the progression towards heavy foreign investment in extractive industries has created a vicious circle of deteriorating governance, declining foreign aid, and further reliance on extractive industries.  The development implications of this shift are growing income inequality and chronically high unemployment for the bulk of Mozambique's citizens.  The strongest evidence of the perils of Mozambique's megaproject-led growth to achieve development goals can be found at the microeconomic level.  The International Finance Corporation was one of the main sponsors of the Mozal plant on the premise that it would aid Mozambique's economic development both in terms of job creation and backward linkages to other industries but also through sponsorship of a trust focused on educational and health programming in the vicinity of the plant.  Survey data conducted by Demographic and Health Surveys of 1,968 individuals in 1997 and 2,774 individuals in 2003 allow for a difference-in-differences econometric analysis of the impact of industrialization on a range of development indicators around Mozal compared to neighboring Gaza province.  This analysis shows development indicators related to educational attainment declined in relative terms, as did access to running water and the share of female employment.  Improvements came mainly in the form of purchased assets such as phones and refrigerators.  The impact on health indicators is mixed, although it appears knowledge of AIDS declined relatively in the industrialized areas.  Possible explanations for these findings are both a rise in slum living conditions and migration of less educated individuals in search of work but also higher incomes.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6eadccc54194a859c9c3213cc7eca596"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Economic assistance</subject><subject source="local">Macroeconomics</subject><subject source="local">Microeconomics</subject><subject source="local">Developing countries</subject><subject source="local">Developing Economies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9d66c525e35bd33d9882d422c86becb8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Building Peace and the State in Somalia: The Case of Somaliland</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ridout, Timothy</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d67ccf54ac448b88ee49f5273b47a054">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Somalia has not had a central state apparatus since 1991. It is generally viewed as anarchic and filled with Islamists, warlords, and pirates. This is only part of the story, however. Somaliland declared independence in 1991 and set about building what has become a robust democracy. Its peacebuilding process during the 1990s was so successful because of five key factors: shared identity, leadership, inclusiveness, local ownership, and innovation rooted in tradition. The experience of Somaliland can offer insights into how to improve the situation in the rest of Somalia. This piece analyzes Somailand's peacebuilding process in the context of modern Somali history, and proposes certain measures that could help promote peace and stability in the rest of Somalia.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1461df42a010219047bc033ac8c4b2e4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Somalia--Politics and government</subject><persname source="local">Somaliland (Secessionist government, 1991-)</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8550b0484668a6ad62dcf33c3e677912" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Effectiveness of Peacekeeping as a Management Tool for Political Crisis: A Case Study of Somalia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Opio, Richard B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7c0f60837fe67847a8bf566a6e2942f3">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Since the ouster of the dictator Siyad Barre in 1991, Somalia has gone through years of turmoil and terrible humanitarian crisis. The situation in Somalia metamorphoses from one picture to another with no sign of moving in a positive direction. Since the time the international community decided to respond from 1992 to date, peace and security  has eluded the ordinary people of Somalia; who continue to live in squalid and dangerous conditions that has cost the failed state millions of life. This thesis sought to examine the efforts by the international community to stabilize Somalia. The findings reveal that the biggest problem of all these efforts have been attempts to export, copy and paste solutions foreign to the life and uniqueness of the clan-based system of allegiance. I conclude that a solution to Somalia's political fiasco lies with the people of Somalia through a sustained dialogue that will build a contextual solution to its settings.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a9c1d91cd9baf027219d1b23cd64ffa4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Somalia--Politics and government</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8106605d8447332563e8d27f96fba47f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Myanmar's Sittwe: A Case of Sino-Indian Geopolitical Competition in the Indian Ocean</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tan, Galen Chern Ming</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_958dfc8d4d1fa4ef706552c0342b4ede">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: Consumers evaluate products not only by explicit attributes such as brand, price, or design but also by perception of country where those products are made. Such effects that country of origin has over products are called the country-of-origin effects. Many researchers have studied this topic since 1960s and the number of research articles on the country-of-origin effects was still high in 2000s. In addition to the academic researchers, there are many governments trying to brand their images in order to take an advantage of the country-of-origin effects. Advertisement campaigns and brand experience management programs, such as quality controls, are utilized for the branding. Building upon these researches and practices, the purpose of this thesis is to analyze possible conflicts between country image policies and industrial policies and to suggest ways to manage this friction. Governments need to consolidate the branding policies with other industrial policies because brand experience management programs can be in contradiction with economic competitiveness of industries. Excessive quality controls over products, for example, weaken innovative dynamism of industries by restricting activities of firms. Having said that, brand experience management programs are indispensable because, as previous cases indicate, advertisement campaigns are often insufficient. For instance, reputation of quality of Japanese products is largely a result of the regulatory export inspection mechanism. Therefore, it is important to harmonize branding policies and other industrial policies in order to utilize the country-of-origin effects as an effective tool for improvement of economic competitiveness. Consistency and flexibility are the keys for such harmonization. Firstly, governments should ensure that brand equity is consistent with strength of industries. For example, environmentally friendly aspect should be promoted if a concerned industry is strong at producing energy-efficient products. Such a branding policy does not require strong restrictions on industries. Furthermore, governments can guarantee to provide products having features that they promised. If there is no adequate strength to be highlighted, governments need to create the strength in the way that improves competitiveness of industries. Secondly, governments should monitor brand equity periodically and flexibly strengthen or weaken the degree of control as necessary. Otherwise, excessive controls will destroy innovative dynamism of industries. For instance, French wine is losing competitiveness partly because of inadequate labeling quality control mechanism. In the essence, harmonization of branding policy and other industrial policies effectively strengthen competitiveness of industries.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9aa98cc6ea1cd2a7b503cae1672d3bc8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Consumer behavior--Cross-cultural studies</subject><subject source="local">Politics and government</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6e808311b3280b2860bd6645df1d9945" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Himalaya Complex: Roads and Conflict in High Asia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Murton, Galen B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5faba362eba517a92153172f13a453dc">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:This paper analyzes how the development of transportation infrastructure throughout the Trans Himalaya affects inter-state relations and intra-state conflict across the greater Inner Asian region. I challenge the realist misperception that purely competitive interests drive both China and India's foreign policies and robust economic growth. Instead, I suggest that a new level of complex connectivity, brought about by modern transportation technology, is transforming the region on an international scale. However, concurrent with this inter-state development is a converse, intra-state dynamic that threatens security in the Himalayan borderlands: many new roads are also creating conflict across western China. My hypothesis is that the development of highways and railroads linking western China with neighboring South and Central Asian countries is utilitarian yet exhibits an oppositional dynamic: international roads enhance regional stability but China's domestic projects cause internal conflict. In order to gauge the net result of these phenomena, I test my hypothesis on this oppositional dynamic with comparative case study analyses. To this end, I examine both inter- and intra-state conflicts in the Tibetan Himalaya as well as make micro case studies on representative road developments, conducted by China and India, in Afghanistan, Kashmir, Tibet, and Sikkim.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5bd45de3e9b8ab8e431a132025a5e594"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Transportation and society</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_604aafd1daec0f3fe92ab74be320d496" level="item"><did><unittitle>Exploring theories of change that UNESCO could implement in its media strategy to most effectively contribute to post-conflict and peacebuilding</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Beccalli, Andrea</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2beee50a21408c857bd1b9675e5fb986">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Peacebuilding is a word loaded of meanings and yet still does not have a common shared understanding. It is a word at the center of international debates and academic investigation, however, if asked to a general audience what are the defining elements of peacebuilding is highly plausible that words like development, reconciliation, democracy, election, would be used but media would not be on the top of the list. If we ask to the same audience the definition of warfare and war making, we would find that the general understanding about the meaning is far clearer, and the role of media would be easily identified and substantiated by clear historical cases. The present research wants to shed some light about the role of media in peacebuilding, it originates from a personal experience in the field of media and international communication as well as from an academic interest and prospective involvement in the field of conflict resolution. The investigating question lies at the crossroad of the conflict resolution and media practice: is a more structured media intervention in post-conflict going to effectively improve the UN led coordinated peacebuilding process? This document aims at providing a theoretical framework that could better drive and support the United Nations Educational and Scientific Organization (UNESCO) contribution to peacebuilding through its programming and multilateral coordinated interventions. As history shows media is often among the   first target of a conflict, communication is diverted to influence news and opinions in the interests of the conflicting parties, mass media are used for fostering propaganda and feeding the conflict attitude. The literature in the field is extensive, but far less documented is the reverse of media harm. The assumption of the present work is that a reliable, independent and pluralistic media has a huge potential for contributing to conflict transformation, through counteracting propaganda, helping in framing issues, defusing mistrust, providing a space to voice emotional reactions, confront positions and interests, and ultimately as an important tool for joint conflict analysis. Because today's wars are prevalently intra-state conflicts, the humanitarian agencies often have to undertake their tasks in the chaotic and lawless conditions. In some, but not all, such cases the resulting horrors explode on to the world's television screens and create political pressure for the United Nations to deploy troops to facilitate and protect the humanitarian operations. While such images can help build support for humanitarian action, such scenes also may create an emotional environment in which effective decision-making can be far more difficult. This aspect of media and UN intervention also defined as the "CNN effect" plays an important role in the peacebuilding process, although influential is not the object of the present investigation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f993a92111d6dbb167b9bbfc2c87a562"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Peace-building</subject><corpname source="local">Unesco</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b0cba16e296156c4943799d3fdbe15f8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Has a New Political Era Changed Iraqi State?

Abstract: Given Jamaica's large current account deficit, revenue from tourism is an essential source of foreign exchange. However, much of it is leaked through imports of inputs for the sector, including food, the hospitality sector's single largest recurring expenditure. With the view that hotel characteristics, such as foreign ownership or being a part of a resort chain may influence the degree to which food is sourced through imports, several interviews were conducted across the hospitality sector to determine the importance of these factors. Within the category of hotels, no obvious correlation could be found between such characteristics and reliance on imported food. On the contrary, all hotels expressed an interest in supporting local farmers, and all claimed to purchase fruits and vegetables almost exclusively from local farmers. However, they all shared the same challenges in sourcing certain high-value food items from local producers, particularly seafood and beef, and these items were almost exclusively procured from overseas.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_28e13afc68e977f186c6685d1b8d5b83"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Tourism</subject><subject source="local">Hospitality industry</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2f4f5f25f842d7fde2b424f8172db1fe" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Ethiopian-Eritrean Dynamic: Classic Proxy Warfare and How a Small Town is Destabilizing the Horn of Africa</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00018</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mahmood, Omar S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8b1b98fce3c6583b0a2699f043590e79">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The inability to achieve wartime objectives has left the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea, in limbo.  However, neither nation is prepared for a return to conventional warfare.  Eritrea is too weak military to alter the situation, while Ethiopia currently occupies Badme and retains good standing within the international community.  The resulting condition of "no war, no peace" has lead to policies of indirect confrontation away from the disputed border, destabilizing the entire Horn of Africa region in turn, through the course of this violent competition. These indirect confrontations have settled mostly around Somalia, as Ethiopia enjoys a number of core security interests that Eritrea has sought to exploit.  Ethiopia seeks to eliminate movements in Somalia that provide safe haven for anti-Addis Abba organizations, carry out terrorist attacks, and have designs on its ethnically Somali inhabited region of Ogaden.  Ethiopia wishes to see dependable, but pliant central government rule, and thus has been propping up the Transitional Federal Government (TFG).  Eritrea on the other hand has purveyed significant assistance to radical Islamist groups opposed to the TFG, mostly in the form of Hizbul Islam, and to a lesser degree Al-Shabaab.  This is the crux of the past decade's war by proxy in Somalia, which has proved highly damaging to the entire region. Uniquely, the avoidance of direct confrontation produced a classic Cold War style proxy war, similar to U.S.-USSR indirect confrontations on distant third party battlefields.  Proxy war however has evolved in the new security paradigm to predominately take place within the nations in conflict, making the chaos in Somalia an exception to the rule.  The proxy war between Ethiopia and Eritrea underwent four iterations, two of which conformed to the classic model; from the late 1990's until 2006, and again from January to December 2009.  The Ethiopian invasion and occupation from December 2006 until early 2009 made it a direct participant to the conflict, causing the proxy war to become a one sided affair.  Since December 2009 though, the conflict has been in decline, marked by Ethiopia's withdrawal and Eritrea's subsequent drawdown. Eritrea's drawdown has occurred for a number of reasons, including the imposition of U.N. sanctions, the decline of Hizbul Islam, the lack of influence over Al-Shabaab, and incompatible long term goals.  Yet the reduction of machinations in Somalia neither represents an improvement in relations nor a change in tactics, but rather that the stakes for continued Eritrean involvement in this arena have become too high.  Despite not accomplishing long term objectives, proxy war will continue to be a policy option of choice because it provides an effective, low-cost measure to pursue short term gains.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e6cb57ceecacab430460558e33cdbcc3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Boundaries</subject><subject source="local">Foreign relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d07dbbc01c773374e7fe79ff2e27f41c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP): How Does it Contribute to Increated Competitiveness of ASEAN?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.078.00019</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Beppu, Mayumi</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ec4f2f3cdd51c0d0e27d6569d4108785">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper first investigates how the ASEAN member countries attained economic development by receiving FDI and what is the motivation to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). It then examines whether the TPP will have a positive impact on the ASEAN countries. It is hypothesized that the International Investment Agreement(IIA) itself in general does not increase FDI, but rather it is used to protect existing FDI and increase the competitiveness of the ASEAN countries by securing predictability and transparency. It is also expected that the TPP will provide a "spillover" effect which encourages integration and liberalization of the ASEAN.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fbd8b527259e0abe7d574c1e3d7bca28"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (2006)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2234a07a3ebc272cced9e79ae12cc37a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Post-Cold War Defense Contracting Consolidation: Leadership and Survival Strategies Used by Today's Largest Defense Contractors</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.079.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nguyen, Laurence B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2196a03c96dfa1524426022959804b87">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of International Business at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: Nuclear power provides benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions, low operating costs, baseload power, and energy independence. It also raises significant concerns regarding capital cost, safety, regulation, waste, public perception and proliferation. Recently there has been renewed interest in nuclear power due to small modular reactors (SMRs), that some argue could bring a "renaissance" of the industry. This thesis first presents an analysis of large-scale nuclear power focusing on benefits and concerns, and then examines the new SMR trend. It assesses whether SMRs are a game-changer for the industry towards nuclear resurgence by analyzing promising models and perceived benefits and costs of SMRs. Based on extensive literature review, 22 expert interviews and economic modeling, the conclusion is that nuclear power as an energy source should be pursued as part of a larger energy portfolio with specific government intervention, while SMRs, although likely not game-changers per se, can play a complementary role in re-inventing the industry without significant support from policy-makers.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a000a94b7f6574b8b3d86e4cfdb5953d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear power plants--Technical innovation</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear energy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_08d9fdaccd6caebb1cf01872dd91b021" level="item"><did><unittitle>U.S. Public Diplomacy in Pakistan: Challenges and Prospects for the Future</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.079.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mahmood, Sana</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_25582c3a94af325f7e892e9309dbe672">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The US-Pakistan relationship has historically oscillated. Today, a strong partnership between the United States and Pakistan is critical to the success of the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and to the broader goal of countering violent extremism. However, the relationship is plagued by a significant trust deficit and suffers from a major disconnect between official relations and public perceptions. If Pakistani public opinion of the US remains acutely negative it may limit the extent of Pakistani cooperation on U.S. policy initiatives and threaten bilateral relations. Effective public diplomacy will be a critical component for transforming US-Pakistan relations and establishing an enduring partnership. This paper assesses the variety of public diplomacy methods and instruments the United States is currently employing in Pakistan, the greatest challenges to their success, and prospects for the future. It emphasizes the need to elevate the role of public diplomacy in US strategy toward Pakistan and concludes that through strategic dialogue, media engagement, educational and professional exchanges, development assistance and a number of other effective tools and instruments, the United States is beginning to create a new narrative about its relationship with Pakistan, based on shared values and interests.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a18f80f9b002d970882a176f3010e487"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">United States--Foreign relations--Pakistan</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e67905eaf62b4eeab3d8e9ab8d5ebbf9" level="item"><did><unittitle>New Tools, Old Goals: Comparing the Role of Technology in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and The 2009 Green Movement</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.079.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rahaghi, John A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_42a6a5c1adfb624d0cb9f3b5ff407cee">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: What role does technology play in a mass uprising or revolution?  Can it aid in fomenting mass protests?  In the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the technology of the day - cassette tapes and photocopied pamphlets - were credited with helping faciliate the revolution.  In 2009, modern communication tools such as the Internet and mobile phones were present in Iran, but the uprising was not successful.  By comparing the two events, it becomes clear that one has to understand the opposition: its goals, structure, organization, leadership, and the political context involved, before determining the role of technology.  Once a movement is defined, the specific use of technology for recruiting, motivating, organizing, and informing the outside world can be understood.  Technology is not inherently revolutionary in and of itself, and is dependent on the users if it is to achieve the lofty attributes some ascribe to it.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3e8ffc5c0b883e5a2eb075b15bbf6e69"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Green revolution--Iran</subject><subject source="local">Iran--History--Revolution, 1979</subject><subject source="local">Technology--Social aspects</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b2096f593d4a7583e2f528771cfca2fb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Two Level War Games: The Domestic Factors that Influence Presidential Decision-Making to Use Force in Minor Conflicts</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.079.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nadeau, Paul J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0c4992cda1b07e337f7799e9fd48291e">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Research that has analyzed presidential decisions to commit to military force have traditionally either focused on international trends or, if considering domestic trends, have generally focused on major conflicts. While certain domestic factors such as economic conditions, in group/out group sociological hypotheses, and presidential popularity may all plausibly apply to the use of force in major conflicts it is more difficult to determine how strongly these might hold up in minor conflicts where the goals and application of force is limited and when there is usually little direct threat to the homeland itself.

Abstract: Every day, low-income households make financial decisions about how to allocate their money. This is especially challenging for them as they face high limitations in their financial resources and sources of income. Gambling is one of such available options. However, it has been deeply studied as compulsive behavior or pathology, but it has been systematically ignored as a gateway to understand individual's motivations to allocate finite, limited, scarce resources in games of chance as a financial strategy. In order to explore the role of gambling as a financial strategy, the case of the Colombian gambling game called chance is used. Chance is widely played in Colombia, mainly by low-income households. In contrast to other financial decisions, playing chance is highly motivated by cultural and social factors related with luck, superstition, regret aversion and subjective probability which play a fundamental role in the decision making process. In addition to this, the exclusion of these households from the formal financial system restricts their ability to access different management financial tools that could allow them to achieve better standards of living. Finally, key learning findings from the Colombian case are identified to illustrate the relevance and need to understand the role of gambling in the life of low-income households.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5b5d251ced35d275d22d4549ed9b83af"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Gambling</subject><subject source="local">Finance, Personal</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_21e0615f34a45ffaa124860e64c59fab" level="item"><did><unittitle>Performing Past, Present and Possibilities in Irish Modern Dance Theatre's 'Fall and Recover:' A Case for Using Dance in Peacebuilding</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.079.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Steele, Mariah G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e1da0d44cfdc5230a32bed885f48c50a">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This thesis addresses the research question: What contributions can dance – both experiential and watched – make to peacebuilding projects?  An in-depth case study of 'Fall and Recover,' a dance by Irish Modern Dance Theatre, whose cast is comprised of two professional dancers and eleven survivors of torture and asylum seekers to Ireland, helps answer this question.  We find that dance is particularly well positioned to replenish individuals' cognitive, emotional and intuitive capacities blunted or destroyed by trauma and conflict that are necessary for peacebuilding to occur.  Moreover, dancing in a group or watching a performance can also foster several of Cynthia Cohen's seven elements of reconciliation and all four of John Paul Lederach's core essences of peacebuilding.  This research overall highlights the ways in which dance could be incorporated into future healing or peacebuilding projects for effective and long-lasting results.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a9cdd835104cfffc356d5d056be623a3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Peace-building</subject><subject source="local">Dance--Social aspects</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9a71aaa7299a23602d1e314d89cfa2d5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Balancing Tradeoffs: Adaptability and Flexibility in the U.S. Legal Approach to Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.079.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ladha, Rizwan R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e54b7f20f6a1b93b6f7e44bbbc631a38">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The United States has, over the past forty years, used a full spectrum of legal vehicles to overcome domestic political obstacles and advance its arms control and nonproliferation agenda. Namely, the United States has employed the formal treaty (in the cases of START I and New START), the executive agreement (in the case of SALT I), the non-legally binding pledge (in the case of the Proliferation Security Initiative), and the unilateral action (in the case of the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives). Each of these vehicles offers certain benefits and constraints that can be judged on the basis of objective arms control and nonproliferation-specific criteria; at the same time, because international agreements are generally subject to some type of domestic approval process by a national legislative body, each mechanism presents a separate set of challenges with respect to the likelihood that an agreement would find domestic acceptance. This paper will argue that the United States has leveraged this full spectrum of legal mechanisms to overcome domestic political hurdles and continue making progress on arms control and nonproliferation. The legal flexibility of the U.S. approach to these issues has allowed it to insulate its arms control agenda from domestic politics; although that protection has sometimes come at the expense of the strength of individual agreements, the multi-pronged legal approach taken by the United States in its arms control and nonproliferation endeavors has been the most prudent one in the long term.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5086427acb92851a5b9d3b20d499aa64"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear arms control</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear nonproliferation</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear energy--Law and legislation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1f3f65f67ef01022e7fd3b9178d104f9" level="item"><did><unittitle>From Aspiration To Obligation: The Evolving Right to Education  in International Law</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.079.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Leighton, Seth M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5f2c2ba743844a76a98849bcc154a891">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine the emergence of international legal norms concerning education, the extent to which these norms place obligations on states, and the impact of international organizations on clarifying and strengthening these norms. A review of international conventions and declarations concerning education reveals: 1) the repetition and gradual acceptance of certain norms on a global scale, including compulsory free primary education and outcomes related to student learning; 2) the steady expansion of educational rights assured under international law, coming at the cost of clarity and obligatory force; and 3) the increasing difficulty of monitoring and enforcing compliance with educational norms. This paper argues that the operational activities of international organizations have served to clarify several areas of ambiguity in the conventions and declarations by building systems of measurement and developing shared bodies of knowledge. In doing so, they have also influenced the behavior of states to comply with international norms through a mixture of persuasion and acculturation. On the global level, an aspiration has been clearly expressed for education to serve as the means for the individual to rise above the circumstances of his or her birth. The progress made in clarifying and measuring these norms provides a measure of hope that these aspirations are evolving into realizable international obligation.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f1748e2f870a9a53fe8a1486166d172f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">Right to education</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e28403304b2de56f3acf96a257150092" level="item"><did><unittitle>Peacebuilding potential of the international private sector in post-conflict/post-disaster societies</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.079.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bhatnagar, Rahul</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_84f3c0ca260d1022c13fb48b42ee122e">There is a considerable body of research in favor of the role of the international private sector in post-conflict/post-disaster reconstruction.

Social norms and traditions have an _��inner resistance_�� whereby members of any given community maintain certain behaviors to demonstrate belonging and membership. In this way, social practices become intractable, often even after the originating conditions change.  Many social norms are harmless_��e.g., the handshake, allegedly originating from conditions in which strangers offered their hands to show that they were unarmed. However, other social norms can damage mental and physical health, and remain entrenched in spite of campaigns for their elimination that emphasize human rights implications, health complications, and religious justifications.

The concept of the _��dictator_�_s dilemma_�� refers to the balance between authoritarian governments_�_ use of information communication technology for economic development with their need to control the democratizing influences of this technology. This thesis explores this concept by conducting a case study of authoritarian Cuba. It applies a modified version of the _��political replacement effect_�� _�_ a theory that was initially developed by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson (2006), which posits that rulers only adopt technological innovation if it does not threaten their political survival _�_ as a theoretical framework. This study analyzes technology adoption indicators and the training of information technology professionals during three time periods in Cuba (1992-1997, 2000-2005, and 2006-2011) through the lens of this framework. These time periods differ in political and economic dimensions. This thesis finds some empirical support for this theoretical framework. However, it concludes by noting the need for further exploration of how the dictator_�_s dilemma relates to international political dynamics and the image authoritarian governments wish to project to other international actors.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_87c1775669263d45449b2210814af555"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_741fd35c04b8e2f21f6870a465d1fdc7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Modern Family Planning in Mali: An Analysis of the Relative Merits of Fertility Awareness Methods Versus Commodity-Based Methods</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.080.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bailey, Charles R</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fee86bc1afd3e8739ae591c84fbef5b2">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Despite sustained efforts and funding by the international donors and the Malian government, the usage of family planning in Mali lags behind both regional neighbors and the international community.  Only 8.2 percent of Malian women, ages 15-49 use any sort of family planning and only 6.2 percent use modern methods while total fertility rates remain virtually unchanged over the last forty years.  Unmet need is currently estimated at 32 percent of women, with the majority desiring family planning to space their children better.  Fertility Awareness Methods (FAMs) of family planning _�_ also known as Natural Family Planning _�_ may offer a good alternative approach to current commodity-based programs.  While not new, modern FAMs have remained underfunded and underutilized in the developing world and especially in the Malian context, with a commodity-based approach dominating the interventions of governments and donor organizations.  They do, however, hold some potential advantages over commodity-based contraceptives.  They are natural, cheap, require no supply chain, and get around many of the problems that plague the current Malian system, including supply chain management issues, insufficient access to the distribution system by rural communities and the poor, and dependence on foreign donor funding. FAMs may also appeal to Malian women and men in areas where commodity-based contraceptives currently do not, including cultural reasons, approach to gender inequality, concern over commodity side effects, and general opposition to contraception.  While greater experimentation is necessary, a FAMs-based intervention would most likely employ a train-the-trainers model and would be slow in expanding in the short term. A national organization for FAMs providers would also be necessary to maintain standards and facilitate expansion.  Further research is needed to determine how best to market FAMs in a Malian context and to what level couples will commit to learn the methods.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_564cf78ee61ea8d3f8d99532c150cd51"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_093df2ba09cc99d0b2ff9e5a96fb8d2a" level="item"><did><unittitle>International Law and Ungoverned Space</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.080.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hoisington, Matthew</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b87c63370028f1decc56dc1f8cec2fa6">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Ungoverned spaces, strictly defined as _��spaces not effectively governed by the state_�� exist all over the world, presenting particular difficulties to public international law, which is historically premised on sovereignty and state control.  Examples of such spaces include cyberspace, south-central Somalia and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan-Pakistan border.  These spaces destabilize the international system in novel ways_��and they might also be dangerous.  Many of the terrorism plots from the late twentieth and early twenty-first century emanated from _��safe havens_�� afforded by ungoverned spaces.  The lack of governance over certain spaces also raises concerns over development, including the health, education, human rights and economic welfare of affected populations.  To address the challenges posed by ungoverned spaces, both to the discipline of international law and to the stability of the international system, this article first derives a nuanced understanding of the issue from both the security and legal literatures.  It then formulates an interpretive international legal framework and tests it against the real-world example of Somalia.  Through this process it develops a complex argument on how international law should apply to ungoverned space.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f3b42052a376344644a002e07650cd8e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_6cc370a8aee078c7b94d16fe465b2365" level="item"><did><unittitle>Monetary and Fiscal Policy of South Sudan: Analysis of a Newly Independent Oil-exporting Country</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.080.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ichisaka, Kohei</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5a2fabc4e9ee9a9f9afffa77f203bb23">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. In May 2012, the Republic of Southern Sudan (South Sudan) is the newest country in the world. The economy of South Sudan was devastated by more than fifty years of the civil war with Sudan, but its economic level is as rich as neighboring East African countries, thanks to its abundant oil resources. Still, its actual economy is impoverished, with more than fifty percent of citizens living below the poverty line. The country suffers from high inflation, led by price increases in basic goods. Oil production in South Sudan is expected to start declining after production peaks around 2015. To achieve economic development, the Government of South Sudan (GoSS) allocates portions of its annual budget, ninety-eight percent of which comes from oil products, to the sectors necessary for economic growth. In monetary policy, the Bank of South Sudan (BoSS) currently applies the floating exchange rate regime with a band of SSP 2.9 to 3.3 to a U.S. Dollar. BoSS is also obliged to control the high inflation rate in order to stabilize the economy. With respect to fiscal policy, GoSS has effectively managed its fiscal balance since the CPA in 2005. Thanks to its abundant oil revenues, GoSS is able to allocate its financial resources to critical sectors. However, continuing conflict with Sudan forces GoSS to spend its budget for security as the first priority, while other areas such as infrastructure, health, and education are left behind. As non-oil private sector industries are still too primitive to contribute to the governmental revenues, GoSS is facing a serious budgeting problem due to its focus on expected oil revenues. To suggest possible solutions for the situation, this paper makes recommendations for the monetary and fiscal policy of South Sudan. In monetary policy, BoSS should shift its exchange rate regime to a currency basket that includes the major currencies of its oil export partners. The currencies included should be the Singapore Dollar and Chinese Renminbi as well as the U.S. Dollar, and the exchange rate for SSP should continue to be held within a band vis-�_-vis the U.S. Dollar. As Kuwait has already discovered, the currency basket regime will enable South Sudan to effectively reflect the economic conditions of its export partners. In order not to lose the effect of inflation control, South Sudan should manage the currency basket portfolio by flexibly adjusting the portions of the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. In fiscal policy, South Sudan should enhance relations with international financial institutions (IFIs) and international community members that give aid as a form of development assistance. IFIs, including the World Bank, IMF, and African Development Bank, have been providing loans to South Sudan for the development of new oil wells and basic infrastructure. The international community, consisting of countries in advanced economies, will effectively complement the scarce investments made by GoSS in the fundamental sectors.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5dd843dad23b07873cd496115922ff9d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_c868ad396a814bdefdf46dda63ad7b4f" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Compatibility of REACH Regulation with WTO TBT Agreement</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.080.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Yaygir, Duygu Cecen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4cc9a36dd7aa759235207dee74fa8d6a">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. This contribution analyses the comprehensive chemicals legislation implemented by the European Union (EU) since 1st June 2007, known as REACH Regulation, from the perspective of WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement. The focus of this study is to investigate certain aspects of REACH, which are likely to be subject to WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). Thus, first of all, the thesis lays down the objectives and main procedures of the REACH with respect to registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction. Second, it examines the ongoing discussions and main concerns of WTO member states regarding REACH under TBT Committee Meetings. Lastly, it asks which of these concerns might be brought to WTO DSB in the future and to what extent they might be defended under TBT Agreement. This preliminary analysis concludes that even though EU seems to be in a strong position due to its high level of aim known as human health and environment protection, the compatibility of some requirements of REACH with TBT Agreement might still be questioned seriously. &#13;

A country_�_s electoral system guides how its citizens vote and how those votes are translated into political power, specifically through the allocation of seats in parliament. Many scholars and practitioners of democratization and development promote certain modifications of electoral systems as means to reduce internal conflict, increase women_�_s political participation, and deepen democracy. At the same time, though, some of these very scholars and practitioners recognize the endogenous nature of electoral system change: like any set of rules, these reforms are the outcome of elite bargaining, public pressure, and societal constraints. Unfortunately, this contradiction goes largely unaddressed, and is certainly unresolved, in the literature on electoral systems. In this paper I make an attempt _�� and I encourage other attempts _�� to fill this gap. After reviewing the literature on electoral systems, I focus on one supposed outcome of electoral reform, increased women_�_s political participation. Using a System Dynamics computer model, I illustrate the many factors identified by scholars as intermediaries of the effects of electoral systems. Then I turn to an econometric methodology: I replicate the approach of a prominent scholar, and I find both the social science assumptions and the dataset used across the field to be flawed. Finally, I perform a case study of the recent and ongoing electoral reform in Nepal. I find what my earlier theoretical and quantitative research suggested: electoral systems are but a small part of the political process and unlikely to be determinative for any purported outcome. This paper urges caution by both scholars and practitioners against generalizing knowledge about electoral systems and applying it uncritically in each new context.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_97bebb752c6d4d7ae9a3daff521147d9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_57820f48c89a0479c02b51115e4980a9" level="item"><did><unittitle>Of Lion Hearts, Terrible Wolves and Sacrificial Lambs: A Comparative Analysis of the Rationale and Conditions for Suicide Attacks in Japan during WWII and Iraq Post-2003</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.080.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Berry, Robert</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ddb33bb7eaae3a8389c4353da03d0bd0">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Suicide attacks are a defining feature of 21st Century political violence and a signature of modern terrorism. Often, the cause of the phenomenon is written off as religious fervor or extremism, which proves to be extremely poor analysis. Indeed, in order to curb the usage of suicide attacks it is critical that they are understood beyond this conventional 'wisdom,' which inhibits critical thinking and detracts from the conversation. This work is a comparative analysis of two vastly different case studies that yet have two of the highest instances of suicide attacks in history: The Japanese kamikaze toward the end of the Pacific War and Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in the Iraq War. After thoroughly debunking the overly simplistic argument that religious extremism causes suicide attacks, and the 'us versus them' worldview it stems from, this work uses primary and secondary source literature to bolster the argument that suicide attacks occur at a crossroads where (1) organizational strategy requires such an attack (due to a dynamic of asymmetric war) and (2) willing individuals to carry out such an attack meet, both of which are furthermore arrived at via (a) a moral persuasion to assert an identity specifically influenced by a 'culture of death,' as well as (b) a sense of crisis at the level of an existential threat, whether real or perceived. A 'culture of death,' moreover, is shown to be a culture that attaches an intrinsic moral value to an altruistic, voluntary death that is connected to basic identities an individual has, including gender and national identity. This work is at once part political science hypothesis and part comparative literature project. It serves as the beginning of a much larger endeavor to compare instances of suicide attacks through history with the hope of truly understanding them.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_41aed37924cd015d0804617a2fb6c077"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_d872f410847d1835125b03c7e4aae70e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Peacebuilding Potential of the International Private Sector in Post-Conflict/Post-Disaster Societies</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.080.00015</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bhatnagar, Rahul</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_16b26e0e5135f4533b34989a35413247">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of International Business at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

The Southern Energy Corridor emerged as an idea describing the network of oil and gas pipelines bringing resources from the Caucasus through Turkey to Eastern Europe. It arose as a way for Europe to diversify its energy dependence on Russia, which supplies roughly 40% of the market. The thesis evaluates the various projects for transporting natural gas in the Caucasus and Southeast Europe and the strategic nature of each project. It also addresses the key risk variables for the projects that make up the Southern Energy Corridor and provides recommendations for key policymakers and private sector stakeholders.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c807df404f921ec4285895bcea3a05b1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_14fdb95fb20a63ea58099657af5d7204" level="item"><did><unittitle>GDP Warrant Design for Greek Debt Restructuring- Lessons from the Argentine Default</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.080.00017</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cao, Ye</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_48983082705bf0b3070cc81c31e73823">Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of International Business at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. This paper designs a GDP-linked warrant for Greek debt restructuring with an examination of the Argentine experience. It discusses the benefits of GDP warrants for sovereign issuers and investors. It also develops a Black model pricing exercise to calculate the expected net present value of such a warrant, modified after the Argentine warrant. The final inclusion of similar GDP warrants in Greece_�_s PSI suggests that financial innovation, such as GDP warrants, is conducive to sovereign debt restructuring process and might mitigate output shocks. This shows a wider adoption of GDP warrants is possible, particularly can be favorable for indebted countries.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_99b7850833d35ca3d0eb7a685b6250db"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_2fe8bc3ebe876c087e2df49b5269830d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Global pro bono: The duty of, and opportunity for, the international private legal sector to contribute to rule of law, development, access to justice and human rights in the developing world</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Heading, Amy</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-04/2013-04">2013-04</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4c02cafc9fa0ab8278e7ab8a5deca892">This thesis begins by providing a snapshot of the emerging field of GPB, within the context of general pro bono and legal sector trends. It presents an overview of how GPB is presently undertaken by law firms, and includes detail on the structure, regional focus, and features of the implemented programs. The author argues that there is not simply an opportunity but in fact a duty for large international law firms to undertake this kind of pro bono work, as uniquely powerful non-state actors in the global sphere. This duty stems from two sources: first, the natural extension of professional responsibility to undertake pro bono within the donor country, with globalization broadening the notion of "society" to which the law firm owes this responsibility; and second, as a crucial component of the developing concept of corporate social responsibility for the law firm as a global business.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5da5118aab3715e5f17c15483a671a7e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6f3e865f02f0469cde4fb235be02779c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Law in International Law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">LLM thesis</subject><subject source="local">Legal assistance to the poor--International cooperation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b64890b8049c62a410c8eb9aad1acbcc" level="item"><did><unittitle>How to Create Efficient, Reliable and Clean Electricity Markets: A Regulatory Design for Mongolia and Northeast Asia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Maidowski, Paul G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012-09/2012-09">2012-09</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2661c398421cc856aa12526cae04fc9b">This paper develops a comprehensive proposal for how Mongolia's domestic power sector could be made more efficient, reliable and sustainable. The analysis is based on interviews in Ulaanbaatar. It reviews the literature on power sector reforms in small developing countries and regional electricity markets. In a second step, a framework is proposed for a regional electricity market between Mongolia, Russia and China. In principle, this framework is applicable also to South Korea and Japan. The findings include that inadequate regulation has contributed to performance problems in every aspect of Mongolia's power sector, which remains a horizontally integrated monopoly. A lack of generation capacity was ignored for decades; as a result, supply is expected to fall critically short of demand for the coming 3 to 5 years. Mongolia possesses rich coal resources, but water scarcity, harmful emissions, high vulnerability to the effects of climate change, social constraints and the need for economic diversification will limit the future role of conventional technologies. Indeed, by exporting electricity from large thermal plants to China, Mongolia would "import" China's emissions and water use. In contrast, Mongolia's vast wind and solar resources could provide a large share of domestic electricity supply. They promise significant export potential and low long-term costs. A Northeast Asian electricity market might develop, based on economic and environmental benefits: China is interested in electricity imports from neighboring countries such as Mongolia and Russia in order to meet its carbon intensity and energy efficiency targets by 2020. First cross-border projects are being planned in Northeast Asia. Such regional electricity markets will likely develop in the future, based on large economies of scale and complementary peak demand patterns. Relevant examples are regional electricity markets in South East Europe, in the EU and Northern Africa (Desertec), and in the Greater Mekong Subre-gion. Due to Japan's high electricity prices, some even claim that it might be economically feasible to export electricity from wind, PV and CSP projects in Mongolia via Russia to Japan. However, numerous challenges let such a vision appear distant at best.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_468251a5252e346376ab1191bac6b8b1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4ada21f1d8f3b2364abd5e0bb9cbcdf9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Mongolia</geogname><geogname source="local">Russia</geogname><geogname source="local">China</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Electric power systems</subject><subject source="local">Electric utilities--Government policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_64a6b80347d94346ff5b98b69195a1c1" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Wrong Side of the Street: Examining Urban Violence and Resilience in Managua, Nicaragua Through a Spatial Lens</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gordon, Rachel H</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-01/2013-01">2013-01</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fad72b9d341675e3a3442deb6c1e2ae2">Urban violence is a growing concern among policymakers, development practitioners, governments, and--most importantly--citizens the world over. While the past several decades have seen decreases in inter-state conflicts, rising chronic or "daily" violence threatens to undermine possibilities for peace and stability in both post-conflict and historically more stable states. Such violence manifests in a variety of ways from petty crimes by street children to narco-warfare between organized criminal groups and law enforcement to the sexual and gender-based violence that pervades both the public and private spheres but is rarely acknowledged as a category of urban violence worthy of the same policy attention and resources. This thesis based on desk research and six weeks of fieldwork in Managua Nicaragua explores the concepts and experiences of urban violence in one of the cities of the Global South that has supposedly fared better against the trends. It examines citizens' experiences of violence and their strategies of coping and resilience in order to better understand how Managua has remained relatively safer than similar cities particularly its neighbors in El Salvador Honduras and Guatemala (currently the world's most violent region) and what its prospects might be for the future.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9e7e60351af9f205b54e8ba9d9013f1b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9f56772bd74d6d1c3593543ec0758233"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Managua (Nicaragua)</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Urban violence</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c6e15cad9298dd7f94bdafc3d7c82392" level="item"><did><unittitle>Civil War in Algeria (1991-2002) and its Aftermath: Analyzing the Emergence &amp; Evolution of Non-State Armed Groups</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Peckarsky, Micah G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-04/2013-04">2013-04</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0b05acf6680c466d819181d7c0621d4f">The Algerian civil war (1991-2002) and its aftermath represent a rich case study to analyze the formation and evolution of non-state armed groups. While the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN, National Liberation Front) built its legitimacy through a war of liberation to end French colonial rule, the regime's authority began to wane in the late 1980s and was ultimately threatened by the Front Islamique du Salut (FIS, Islamic Salvation Front) through elections in December 1991. In order to protect its authority, the Algerian military intervened in January 1992 to cancel the electoral process and suppress the FIS, radicalizing the political opposition and touching off a bloody civil war that raged for more than a decade and featured a variety of armed Islamist groups challenging the FLN-military regime. Through a strategy of intense manipulation and infiltration of the militant organizations, as well as an amnesty program, the Algerian government remained in power and has bolstered its position since 2002. However, despite the Algerian administration's resurgence, the last remaining armed group in the civil conflict - the Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat (GSPC, Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat) - evolved into Al-Qaeda in the Land of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in the mid-2000s. AQIM does not pose an existential threat to the Algerian government or military, but constitutes a security risk inside Algeria and throughout the Sahara-Sahel region, particularly in northern Mali, based on the group's transnational operations, shift to a decentralized organizational structure, exploitation of ungoverned areas, foreign relationships, strengthening due to instability in Libya and Mali, and criminal activities. This assessment traces the development of Algeria's security environment from the late 1980s to the present, analyzing the government's declining legitimacy in the late 1980s that led to the outbreak of the civil war, the regime's effective policies that enabled it to maintain power and subdue its armed challengers, and the organizational innovations pursued by AQIM allowing it to endure.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0de6d184b98fb4d3412e7b4cb1816ceb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4faeaea9c3be4a115e3bcd74cb2c4d6e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Algeria--History--Civil War, 1992-2006</subject><subject source="local">Militia</subject><subject source="local">Dissenters</subject><corpname source="local">Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_74f18110e1fcca6cb70a5ee987572699" level="item"><did><unittitle>When Elections Do Not A Democracy Make: The 2010 Elections in Sudan</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Trithart, Albert B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_20adb619c9b819dbd4d4e0587ad6c1b6">Since the end of the Cold War, elections have become a standard component of peace agreements ending civil wars. Multiparty elections have become the only internationally acceptable way to legitimize transitional institutions and authorities. But are elections an effective means of realizing democratic principles? Can elections cause democratization? While empirical studies can help answer this question, individual cases can elucidate the specific factors that underlie elections as democratizing agents.  In this paper, I will focus on the case of Sudan's 2010 elections, which did not result in democratization. I ask two related questions: What were the reasons for including provisions for elections in the CPA? And why did these elections not contribute to democratization in Sudan as intended? This paper is divided into five main sections. First, I contextualize the discussion within the literature on democratization by elections. Second, I provide a brief background of the negotiations leading to the CPA, with particular attention to discussions related to the elections. Third, I turn to the first question posed above, assessing the rationale behind the provisions on elections in the CPA. Fourth, I turn to the second question, reassessing this rationale in light of events that occurred during the transition period. Finally, I offer conclusions as to how the elections might have contributed to democratization. I conclude that elections were necessary in order to achieve two goals: 1) to legitimize the possibility of unity and 2) to justify the exclusionary nature of bilateral negotiations. Elections could only achieve these goals if they were democratizing - if the elections did not contribute to a democratic outcome, they could neither legitimize unity nor accommodate all the groups excluded from negotiations. Despite a lack of democratic commitment from both the NCP and SPLM/A, it was not entirely unrealistic to hope that elections would be democratizing, based on assumptions made during CPA negotiations. Events following the CPA, however, undermined these assumptions. Neither the SPLM nor northern opposition parties seriously challenged the NCP in national elections. The SPLM focused on elections in southern Sudan, while northern opposition parties did not mobilize their supporters, resulting in a disorderly last-minute election boycott. Moreover, the international community did not follow through on its commitment to democratizing elections. Instead, international actors prioritized justice (through the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for President Omar al-Bashir) and peace (through a referendum on southern independence) over democracy. Finally, Sudan adopted a complex electoral system that inhibited power sharing. These post-CPA conditions undermined the prospects for democratizing elections.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ca3a9e5ab9599ffbdd0a6b53d5349479"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e53970a9d7c96d56c630d18350a5ad65"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Sudan</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, Sudan People's Liberation Army (2005)</subject><subject source="local">Elections--Sudan</subject><subject source="local">Democratization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_693a7339dcc4bb548812dfd3d934d46e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Letting the Sun Shine in: The Role of Development Finance Institutions in Catalyzing Investments in the Indian Solar Industry</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dutta, Shuvam</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-04/2013-04">2013-04</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3960154f582fa91210627b012f8e3526">Access to energy is a fundamental building block of economic development, yet many developing country power sectors face acute challenges with insufficient and expensive generation compounded by limited and ageing distribution infrastructure. India is no exception to this trend. About 100,000 villages in India (17 percent) remain un-electrified, and almost 400 million Indians are without electricity coverage. Untold numbers of businesses suffer from lack of reliable power for industrial processes or because they cannot get their goods to the market. Solar energy is the largest renewable resource available and solar photovoltaic is the fastest growing energy source in the world. Consequently, massive investment has been occurring globally right across the solar supply chain. A massive drop in the installed costs of solar photovoltaic and the increasing cost of fossil fuels is making solar increasingly more competitive with traditional sources of electricity. Solar photovoltaic is particularly well suited to off-grid applications, making it ideal for rural electrification. In this paper, I outline the opportunity that solar power represents for India to address its energy deficit and how fostering private sector participation is pivotal to ensure that the capacity of renewable energy is harnessed for development in India.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c85aa97e7c0d32fa590d646e437f8369"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c6c0743fba9205c44a8809e725c0af01"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">India</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Solar energy--Finance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_eaa554689ac86b06377983a9a4c634ac" level="item"><did><unittitle>To what extent will the Panama Canal expansion lower transportation costs and enhance the competitiveness of exports from the United States?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Metcalf, Shelton D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-04/2013-04">2013-04</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_56d850b4dade3df8f894148d5e908d84">The Panama Canal expansion plan, on pace to be completed in 2015, has the potential to alter international shipping routes.  The $5.2 billion infrastructure project calls for building a third channel that will accommodate post-Panamax vessels, which will double the capacity limits for the canal.   Additionally, some specialized vessels will be able to use the Canal that previously could not.  As a result, exporters, logistics experts, port authorities, vessel operators, and many others are eagerly anticipating its completion. For the United States, the canal expansion is expected to benefit trade between the U.S. Gulf Coast and East Coast and Asian markets because using the canal significantly shortens the distance and transit time between these two locations.  The expansion also permits the use of larger vessels that take advantage of economies of scale.  In short, the improved canal is believed to reduce transportation costs for U.S. exports using this route, making U.S. export goods more competitive on the international market.  However, this outcome is not assured for many reasons.  First, other shipping routes have advantages that will compete with the Panama Canal.  The main, competing routes from the U.S. Gulf to Asia are through the Suez Canal and around the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa).  Second, many U.S. and Asian ports have draft limitations that exclude larger vessels from entering their harbors.  Any increase in these ports drafts will take time and large financial investments.  Third, the possibility of longer average transit times could counteract the benefits of the Panama Canal.  Therefore, it is inconclusive at this point whether the expanded Panama Canal will be better than the alternatives and furthermore, whether it will have a positive impact on U.S. export competitiveness. Additionally, a key factor influencing U.S. export competitiveness via the Panama Canal expansion is the Canal toll rates.  The Panama Canal Authority is keen to recoup its investment costs from the expansion project, and higher toll rates are expected.  However, it is unknown by how much, or if at all, the rates will rise. To assess the impact of future Panama Canal on U.S. exports, this paper will first evaluate the transportation costs for select U.S. exports using the Panama Canal (based on its current toll rates) and compare them against the transportation costs using the Suez Canal and Cape of Good Hope routes.  Second, it will conduct a sensitivity analysis test that compares the derived transportation costs for each U.S. export under different Panama Canal toll fee scenarios.  This test will expose how sensitive transportation costs are for each good examined to canal rates vis-a-vis alternative shipping routes.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8831dd52061b1fe3bfe751812bfd226f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ee85a05b3a47daff3749e70b8f574ab0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Panama Canal (Panama)</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Transportation--Cost of operation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a1ed9833b7c3a5f942feacd836c4bee9" level="item"><did><unittitle>Reparations for Child Victims of Armed Conflict: Responding to the Rights and Needs of Children in Transitional Justice</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Miano, Sarah M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-05/2013-05">2013-05</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fc9bc73fd033977260383b3acfcbca10">Modern warfare disproportionately affects children caught in the midst of complex and persistent conflict.  Harm against young people, however, is not merely an unfortunate byproduct of war. Rather, children are frequently targeted in serious crimes under human rights and humanitarian law, including killing, sexual violence, recruitment and use in armed forces or groups, maiming, torture, and denial of basic services, to name a few.  Unfortunately, children's roles as political, economic, and social actors are often undervalued, and their experiences during war are consequently deprioritized on post-conflict agendas. Yet, children are rights-holders and agents of social transformation, and processes seeking justice for victims of armed conflict are remiss to ignore this significant group. This paper explores the potentially meaningful role reparations processes and outcomes can play in facilitating justice for children victimized through serious crimes during armed conflict. Part 1 reviews the transitional justice framework, focusing on existing legal and normative guidance on reparations. This section also introduces children's rights principles, including non-discrimination, best interests, and evolving capacities of the child, which are applied throughout the analysis to ensure children's needs, rights, and protection are prioritized. Part 2 looks at children's experiences of war and the long-term and immediate impact of crimes on their lives, focusing on attributes of age, gender, and cultural context of the child. Parts 3 and 4 utilize the lenses of children's rights principles and attributes to examine the potential for child-sensitive and child-just processes and outcomes of reparation. Ultimately, this paper seeks to fill a gap in literature for approaching reparations for child victims of armed conflict rooted in their experience of war and the impact of harms on their lives.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_38a94c1bf0855aa7b03f34bfe4fd4bbf"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_dbd7c6ad183623b522cfbaa80b7c5c22"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Children's rights--Reparations</subject><subject source="local">Transitional justice</subject><subject source="local">War reparations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a329d69b30a359f35b03d0f9ab87c322" level="item"><did><unittitle>State Manipulation of NGOs: Government-Civil Society Relations in Egypt</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pollock, John P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-03/2013-03">2013-03</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b7e267c1ac3c9ce5c240cb3c7136962f">Egypt has a large and vibrant NGO sector, yet it also has restrictive laws governing NGOs, and the government has frequently cracked down on the sector, both before and after the 25 January Revolution. What explains the size and vibrancy of Egyptian civil society in the face of this repression? After exploring the nature of the NGO sector in Egypt and the government's tools for constraining NGOs, this paper will evaluate possible answers to this question. Internal and external pressures on the Egyptian government as well as a lack of state capacity for repression might explain the size of the NGO sector. However, this paper concludes that the Egyptian government has intentionally promoted the growth of the NGO sector, while using the state's coercive power to influence these organizations. By both promoting and manipulating NGOs, the state has been able to pursue several objectives: providing social services with fewer state resources; co-opting organizations into behaving in accordance with state interests; pitting potential opposition factions against one another; and improving the state's image abroad while discrediting liberalism at home. While the Revolution in 2011 brought renewed hope for legal reform, it is unlikely that these state-civil society dynamics will change in the short term.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_732af06a4f632b614d19f81ca4ff427c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b9ffa675a6e9f9b4bacba38de8785133"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Egypt</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations--Government policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_40e203e5f763372535af9785b2852b4b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Reaching the Base of the Pyramid: An Analysis of Bakhresa Grain Milling Malawi's Inclusive Business Model</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nagasaki, Tomohiro</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-05/2013-05">2013-05</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9e149d75a5a49769e427fb3b22ef9cc1">A growing number of business leaders aspire to raise the well-being of poor populations in the developing world, while also generating profits, by pursuing "inclusive" business models. This thesis offers a description of the inclusive business model pursued by Bakhresa Grain Milling (Malawi) Ltd., and provides an analysis of how this company's outreach among microentrepreneurs (who sell wheat based snacks called mandasi) contributes to its own business success, and how it affects the lives of the entrepreneurs themselves. The research is based on interviews with company personnel, field interviews with microentrepreneurs selling various wheat based products, and secondary household survey data. This thesis suggests that even though the microentrepreneurs are two links in the value chain removed from direct dealings with the company, the company nonetheless recognizes that outreach among them increases the size of its market. While the outreach may increase profits for some microentrepreneurs, it also increases supply and drives down the price of mandasi. It may, therefore, leave some mandasi sellers worse off, while passing on benefits to mandasi consumers, many of whom are part of the base of the pyramid.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bc87c291f917655ea2f62b0d38ebaecc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_0492678ad7e76f235f78fbe9d0484987"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local"> Entrepreneurship -- Developing countries</subject><subject source="local">Microfinance.</subject><corpname source="local">Bakhresa Grain Milling (Malawi) Ltd</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b47ab8dd2d536126101ad9ec38770d51" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Role of Memory in Post-Genocide Rwanda</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Conway-Gaffney, Katherine E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-06/2013-06">2013-06</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3cc900663e5ee69fab2b922b7c6d89c9">Since the end of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide the Rwandan government and institutions within civil society have promulgated an official narrative of the events. This version of the narrative or "official memory" has tailored public remembrance and discourse, limiting the debate about the past. In present day Rwanda, controls exists that curtail open public remembrance, education, and conversations. The role of memory thus becomes a primary consideration in government, civil society, and in the social fabric of the Rwandan people. The government and social institutions control much of the collective memory, limiting discussions of ethnicity and events that took place outside of the specific time frame considered in the official memory. Limits to memory include restrictions on the freedom of speech, a focus on minimizing ethnic identity, methods of memorialization, and control over the versions of memory that are taught in schools, celebrated during the month of April, and discussed in public spaces. This thesis will assess the role of memory in guiding the current narrative of Rwandan society, institutions, and reconciliation ultimately addressing the friction caused in collective remembrance, identity, and social fabric. Subsequently, this thesis will address potential processes of engaging with memory in the present about the past that could include wider truth-telling and grappling with the historical record in order to shift a population towards deeper understanding, and potentially reconciliation, in both private and public spaces.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_86b8cc1b8ea074c34dbc87fe02c438da"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ed36d8ba211b3067b82494e83bc71f5c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Rwanda</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Collective memory--Rwanda</subject><subject source="local">Rwanda--History--Civil War, 1990-1993</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_12e783a0fd921e9dadb19715d7463c88" level="item"><did><unittitle>Technical Efficiency of Rice Production in India: A study using stochastic frontier analysis to estimate technical efficiency and its determinants</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Goldman, Dana Rose</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013-04/2013-04">2013-04</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d11160113bff704f1d0ef7da30b3ab1d">This paper uses household survey data from the 2009 Kharif season in four states in India to estimate technical efficiency of rice production and analyze the determinants of technical efficiency.  Technical efficiency scores and determinants of technical inefficiency were jointly estimated using a stochastic frontier analysis of production functions.  The maximum likelihood approach in FRONTIER 4.1 was employed.  On average, across the full sample (using a full-sample production frontier) farmers were operating with 52.89 percent efficiency.  Farmers in Tamil Nadu were significantly more efficient than farmers in other areas (eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar/West Bengal).  The number of years of formal education of the household head is positively and significantly correlated with technical inefficiency.  Households with heads that are upper caste are significantly less efficient than households with non-upper caste heads.  Households with concrete floors are significantly less efficient than that do not have them.  Households that have a Below the Poverty Line card are significantly less efficient than those that do not have them.  Households with access to piped water are significantly more efficient than those without access.  The positive effects of formal education, caste and concrete floors on technical inefficiency are counter-intuitive results.  Increased education, higher social status and increased household wealth would be expected to have a positive correlation with technical efficiency.  A possible explanation may be that, better educated and higher caste households with more income own more land area and thus do not need to farm their land as intensively as households farming a smaller farm base.  Alternatively, agriculture may not be the primary income generating activity for these households and thus they devote less time and managerial energy to agriculture.	In order to increase technical efficiency in rice production, several policy goals have been identified.  Because of the significant positive effect of fertilizer and pesticide use on output, increased fertilizer and pesticide use should be encouraged.  In addition, due to the significant positive correlation between access to piped water and technical efficiency, increasing access to water infrastructure should be a priority.  Given the high level of technical efficiency in Tamil Nadu, public investment in the state should be directed toward research and development for new technologies that will shift the production frontier outward.  Lower degrees of technical efficiency in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar/West Bengal mean that output growth can be achieved with current technology and thus public investment should be directed to measures that improve technical efficiency, such as training and infrastructure.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_03b9cdc923815f8e76fc7f7e9def76ee"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4552ead185c7a3d8d5f9f68234fca54f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">India</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject><subject source="local">Industrial productivity</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8657aff4ee836b0abb30e19f81e068f5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Participation, National Identity, Media &amp; Technology in Greece</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.081.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kaltsa, Panagiota</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5d19f40e0c03e3c6b77357bd9ac64be6">This work aims to set a framework for governments in crisis to strengthen their identity power and regain the trust of citizens, via participation and new communication technologies.

The American intervention in Iraq in 2003 and the more recent withdrawal of the international troops from the country have directly contributed to the crescent instability in the country. Achieving reconciliation within and between the different sectarian groups living in Iraq is missing. The implementation of a reconciliation process can&#13;
bring not only knowledge and understanding about past crimes and violations of human rights committed, but also it can help building a new institutional democratic structure. In this regard, truth commissions on a national level have proven to be effective reconciliation instruments in contexts of grave violation of human rights, such as Iraq. Approaching a past&#13;

Women's legal status in times of war has historically been that of objects available to the conquering males; sexual violence perpetrated on those spoils of war (or in Latin, Praeda Preda) was a legitimate prerogative of the combatant and a victor's right.
                                It was not until two major intra-state wars confounded the international community both by their intensity and their brutality that the latter's transformation into full subjects of international law occurred. This paper seeks to analyze the evolution of the legal status of victims of wartime sexual violence that has resulted from legal developments of the past twenty years. It explores their shift from objects to subjects of international law as having occurred
                                within the context of the emergence of an individualized perspective on security. Contending that supranational criminal prosecution is crucial to preventing the systemic use of sexual violence in current and mostly intra-state conflicts, it also argues favor of the creation of an engendered human security paradigm informed by norms of refugee, human rights and humanitarian law as a legal tool against impunity.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_65727ce0e96b44e49ab2efb085359492"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4ebdc24c0041207aefcb19097cf538bc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Masters of Law in International Law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">LLM thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Rape as a weapon of war.</subject><subject source="local">War crimes.</subject><subject source="local">Sex crimes (International law)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_80ce753d3c200dfa9c0f6099fe96a8ce" level="item"><did><unittitle>Turning the Lights Back On: Strategies for Private Participation in Electricity Infrastructure in Post-Conflict States</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.082.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Schwartz, Claudia L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_81c66a6b90b88aace6c218fc7af3a235">A comparative study of models to promote private participation in infrastructure, particularly electricity infrastructure, in post-conflict states, with a a focus on the case of Somaliland.

However, this change has not affected all Brazilians equally, with millions still living in favelas and facing marginalization and stigmatization on a daily basis. This thesis begins by discussing the characteristics of favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and
                                their residents and moves to analyze the causes of discrimination against favela residents, including race and gender, and the criminalization of individuals living in favelas. The thesis moves to explore violence in the public and private spheres in the favelas and the way in which the authorities use it as a justification for police operations to restore order in the favelas. It then discusses the growth of violent and organized crime in certain favelas, as well
                                as the state's reaction via military police operations, women's police stations, and Pacifying Police Units, and its effectiveness at responding to violence. Finally, the thesis turns to the responses of favela residents and community organizations, and argues that these groups have had some success in attracting the attention of domestic and international audiences through the use of mainstream and social media, in raising awareness of incidents of police
                                brutality and discrimination, and in obtaining a response from state authorities. However, the state still needs to fill many gaps in order to fully integrate favela residents into Brazilian society and to put an end to policies that exclude these individuals. Brazil's recent growth in political and economic power therefore represents an opportunity for the state to address its legacy of marginalization and discrimination and to formulate policies that will make

Although nascent and sophisticated threats emanating from cyberspace might appear overwhelming, remarkably, there are sufficient parallels between Jihadist terrorism and cyber attacks that can provide useful insights. Both tactics are nebulous, undefined threats that not only jeopardize wide sections of society, but also, make it straightforward for the perpetrators to conceal
                                their identity. These shared attributes complicate efforts to establish a robust deterrence. Yet, the remote plausibility of high impact attacks underscore why these intricate security concerns cannot be ignored. With these parallels in mind, this paper draws upon the lessons learned from over a decade of fighting terrorism, to endorse the following guidelines for cybersecurity policy and strategy: (1) do not ignore deterrence, but recognize that its applications

Myanmar is at an historic stage in its development. Following adoption of a new Constitution in May 2008, parliamentary elections were held in November 2010 and by-elections contested in April 2012. The transition to civilian rule under the new Constitution was the first step in an on-going series of rapid and far-reaching political and
                                economic reforms. The country now faces the challenge of advancing the unification of multi-nations within the state, and establishing rule of law, access to justice, and political power redistribution while simultaneously maintaining economic stability and democratic values. This research paper will examine the ethnic conflict and self-determination of the Kachin ethnic group in the last fifty years and its future. The paper is structured into three broad
                                sections. First, it deals with the Kachin's group identity construction through a historical perspective during the pre and post-colonial period. Second, it explores ways in which international law and its traditional interpretation might respond to self-determination, minority rights and indigenous rights in Kachin's context and how the peace process is being negotiated with the government. It also will explore the question why territorial autonomy and federalism
                                is a hard question partly because it is all parties" second choice positioning in the middle between the government unionist and the ethnic secessionist. Third, it draws challenges of their claims whether it is de jure and de facto feasible in political realities by examining the 2008 Myanmar constitution and its governance structures. It aims to explain why autonomy arrangement in paper alone is not a magic wand and does not necessary meaningful for justice and
                                equality. Finally, the paper tries to come up with futuristic forecast and solution of the conflict in the last section.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d9275bd53e965b4097bfc991d4387eb0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_fbee0356364f28df5fbb4f8b39be19c4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Burma -- Politics and government -- 1988-</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Democratization -- Burma.</subject><subject source="local">Kachin (Asian people) -- Burma.</subject><subject source="local">Ethnic conflict -- Burma -- History -- 20th century.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1218eda505ed3244d14b54294597b9ab" level="item"><did><unittitle>Food Security Resilience in Somalia: A Critical Review and Conceptual Framework for Intervention</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.082.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Paul, Elizabeth L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1d7566069179ac58f1a88331a1bbca37">In the wake of the 2011 famine in Somalia, humanitarian organizations across the globe began to call for a renewed focus on the concept of resilience. Though lacking a commonly agreed upon definition, resilience is generally understood to be the ability of an individual, household, or community to respond to shocks without succumbing to them over time. The 2011 famine and the late and inadequate response of the humanitarian community that followed has prompted
                                many humanitarian actors to develop an organizational focus on building resilience to food security crises, especially in Somalia. This paper attempts to respond to the current demand for resilience-building interventions by developing a better understanding of what a successful food security resilience program in Somalia should and could look like. This paper begins with an indepth analysis of the concept of resilience and corresponding literature and policies,
                                followed by an analysis of existing resilience programs being conducted in Somalia, before concluding with a recommended conceptual framework for building resilience in Somalia that incorporates the sectors and components that are critical in the design and implementation of food security resilience interventions specific to the Somali context. If resilience interventions are to be the future of food security programming in emergencies, their success will depend
                                upon the effective incorporation of a wide variety of sectors into a holistic approach.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_94fed30fc1a862b1e34749f4866b6370"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7549d64be89f6d6c8fea286bba9f8a5a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Resilience (Ecology)</subject><subject source="local">Food security -- Somalia.</subject><subject source="local">Human security -- Somalia.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1ba3051e2625ca01e1d5f52c9c1f71fc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Coercive Coverage?

Nowhere is its effect more widely felt than in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 85% and 90% of all malaria cases and deaths occur, respectively. According to recent WHO estimates, there were roughly 660,000 deaths due to malaria in 2010, 85% of which occurred in children under the age of five. Africa has seen a modest reduction over-all in deaths&#13;
                                in recent years, which has come at a price. Estimates placed the total global R&amp;D funding around US$600m in 2009, with an estimated US$2.3b available for prevention control. However, that $2.3b figure is less than half of the $5.1b estimated to be required to ensure universal access, and the figure of $600m in fact demonstrates under-attention of the present and impending concerns regarding treatment-resistant forms of malaria. Acknowledging the impressive yet&#13;

A history of antimalarial drug medication, with an evaluation of the pros and cons regarding access and cost of current therapies. 2. A review of some creative solutions to overcoming intellectual-property&#13;
                                rights and markets based incentives in a capitalistic economy that may not be naturally inclined to invest in antimalarial medications. 3.

SMR units are advanced reactors (Generation III+ or IV) that are miniaturized to a capacity less than 300 megawatts, that also feature enhanced siting flexibility, improved safety, advanced instrumentation, longer refueling intervals, and a shift to factory production.
                                Nuclear power in the United States has struggled with diseconomies of scale as well as socio-political opposition in recent years, so much so that only two new site builds have been initiated since 1979. SMR is being touted as the answer to the woes of nuclear power, though even the best laid plans of SMR proponents leave many questions unanswered. The process of innovation in energy technologies faces systemic challenges, and policy interventions are needed for
                                nascent developments like SMR to allow it to test the rigors of the commercial market. A potential model for SMR innovation to emulate is the success of a closely-related but often overlooked technology with strong energy-related ties: nuclear attack submarines. Naval Reactors has found tremendous innovation success through tightly knit networks of public-private partnerships that encourages the flow of information, funding, expertise, and a powerful safety
                                culture to all participants. Additionally, nuclear submarine innovation had struggled with cost escalations similar to nuclear energy until a series of policy mechanisms were employed to stabilize submarine economics. The findings of this study point toward a potential model for the Department of Energy and the domestic nuclear industry to emulate in order to support innovation in nuclear energy technologies like SMR.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f10684c1ce365306300e2c4d4191076c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6c44abc49bcbbdabfd77df6a999449ec"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear power plants -- Military aspects.</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear power plants -- Design and construction.</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear submarines.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_eaa4678f4b6ce8ca9b19f52649091f58" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Impact of BRAC's Food for Training and Income Generation Program in South Sudan on Boys' and Girls' Education Outcomes</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.082.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Meadows, Leah B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a30a014e0e2982adf0a14d620dd362ab">This paper presents the results of an impact evaluation of BRAC's Food for Training and Income Generation (FFTIG) program, which took place in South Sudan in 2008.

A central problem regarding American exceptionalism is the imprecision with which it is used, and its vague meaning in contemporary politics. Furthermore, the use of exceptionalism by policymakers across the political spectrum contributes not only to ambiguity surrounding the concept, but also to partisan purposes for specific party objectives. This thesis moves
                                beyond the more political applications of exceptionalism in order to illuminate its origins, core principles, and evolution throughout American history. In so doing, this study seeks to shed light on the often-unarticulated role that exceptionalism and other ideals and beliefs play in the development of U.S. foreign policy. This paper also aims to provide clarity and depth to the study of exceptionalism by exploring the central theoretical frameworks behind the
                                concept, as well as by using various case studies to highlight the practice of exceptionalism within American foreign policy. This research outlines key findings on the role of exceptionalism as an intervening variable within the foreign policy decision-making process. One such finding is that exceptionalism remains, as it has since the country's founding, a central tenet of America's liberal ideology and national identity. Moving forward, exceptionalism will
                                continue to be subject to intense debate " at home and abroad. In order for American policymakers to pursue effective foreign policies that gain domestic and international support, they must be more self-aware of the national biases, ideals, and principles that influence the debate, in order to better articulate America's diplomatic and military tactics and objectives in times of war and peace. Lastly, in the age of American hegemony " and the possible waning of
                                that hegemony " questions of exceptionalism will only continue to become more relevant.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_80f3b279f396a0a699d420146d303fc8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_10144815b7ce6081bb7547d6898a08a0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">National characteristics, American.</subject><subject source="local">Exceptionalism -- United States.</subject><subject source="local">United States -- Foreign relations -- Philosophy.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bced3a467e1f720a7ac00b4142edd1fd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Korea's Multiculturalism Policy and Media Discourse</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.082.00016</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shim, Nari</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7ac7e6407f2adbfedb2f0c63b219fed6">This research paper, based on the quantitative analysis, explores the causal relationship between the South Korean government's multiculturalism policy and television news coverage.

The thesis is divided into five parts. Part I provides background on the current state of Atlantic bluefin tuna and how the fishery is managed domestically in the United States and internationally. Part II provides
                                background on the current state of the world's sharks, explores the history of shark fin consumption, and lastly examines how shark populations are managed domestically in the United States and internationally. Part III goes to the heart of the thesis as it explores the similarities and differences that exist between Atlantic bluefin tuna and sharks and how these factors are driving, or not, their respective conservation efforts. Part IV then returns to
                                international conservation efforts by examining international fishery and wildlife treaties and regimes. Special attention is given to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, or CITES, a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA) that has been, in recent years, ground zero for the debate on how best to address the trade and need to conserve Atlantic bluefin tuna and highly threatened and endangered shark species.
                                Finally, Part V looks to the future of Atlantic bluefin tuna and shark conservation. Possible advances and setbacks in both domestic and international policy arenas are examined. Part V concludes with recommendations for advancing conservation efforts of these two iconic marine predators.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_289180bb29f830f3ad6b631e42ff7d6e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5cb0280786af795782459324130e1185"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Sharks -- Conservation.</subject><subject source="local">Sharks -- Ecology.</subject><subject source="local">Bluefin tuna -- Conservation.</subject><subject source="local">Bluefin tuna -- Ecology.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_dddf240e891b887ecbb591d10335f195" level="item"><did><unittitle>Germany's Unwillingness to Lead: The Nature and Exercise of its Power, and How its History, Normalization, and Economic Concerns Have Brought About an Existential Crisis and Reluctance to Lead Alone</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.082.00018</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Van Son, Ian G.</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ef00a5e49ddf890c68cdeab3989beec2">Germany has entered a new era since reunification and the end of the Cold War, and it continues to search internally as well as externally for its new place in Europe and the world.

Using its influence, Germany has led Europe by acting as a "patron state," committing resources to the task of leadership and shaping international institutions through a hegemony embedded in those institutions. But the Eurozone crisis has tested the limits of Germany's patronage and, in isolating it, caused Germany to step back from a larger leadership role. German leadership has been prevented by its history, its
                                normalization and emboldened pursuit of its national interests, its stretched economy and fear of debt, and a domestic existential crisis resulting in an inability to agree on its future. Germany is finding itself uncomfortable with being a patron without greater influence, but also with carrying the sole responsibility of leading Europe. Germany's strength is built in large part upon its economy, and when it feels that is stretched, it is at risk of losing power
                                and will be more likely to act in its own interests. The Eurozone crisis has seen Germany's position soften as it caves to pressure from the other countries. Germany has too much invested in Europe to back away from its commitment to integration and working within the international institutions it has helped form, but it will seek burden sharing and leadership assistance in the future. Going forward, Germany will seek to share the burden of leadership and
                                patronage, wishing to retain the project of integration, but not at the economic and reputational cost that it has recently sustained.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_acfdae4b0bee38bf2ffb36b1de942c39"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_41d0265ff3d3ed447911adeec825721b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Germany -- Politics and government -- 1990-</geogname><geogname source="local">Germany -- Foreign relations -- 1990-</geogname><geogname source="local">Germany -- History -- 1990-</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5e0191d52410a8e232582832a81967a1" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Somali Insurgency: The Growing Threat of Terror's Resurgence</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.082.00019</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Meservey, Joshua R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_212208a45f16147a05383c229b3da86b">The thesis provides a brief history of the rise of the Islamic terrorist organization al-Shabaab, analyzes its subsequent loss of support within Somalia, and then applies counterinsurgency theory to assess the chances of success of the international intervention currently underway in Somalia.

A mutual gains approach will allow each side to approach the dispute with a better understanding of their interests and the benefits of cooperation. There is an opportunity to redefine the national dialogue in the Philippines and China over fossil fuels and economic growth. The oil and gas resources in the South China Sea have to be valued in a holistic manner, accounting for the environmental and health damages they will cause when burned, in addition to their economic value. There is a similar opportunity in managing fisheries. Fisheries management in the West Philippine Sea has to account for the impact on ecosystems and how to maintain and restore fish stocks in the long run. The success of these initiatives will be determined by the decisions of governments and businesses to accurately value ecological goods and services. As the world moves towards
                international action on climate change and more sustainable fisheries practices the South China Sea is a microcosm of the opportunities and barriers to valuing environmental goods.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_beba9768da9c98b609940d81b7335c16"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b82cc1c3cba35b2c2cf89bdca9e00b2f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Philippines--Foreign relations--China.</geogname><geogname source="local">China--Foreign relations--Philippines.</geogname><geogname source="local">South China Sea--International status.</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Environmental policy--South China Sea.</subject><subject source="local">Petroleum reserves--South China Sea.</subject><subject source="local">Natural gas reserves--South China Sea.</subject><subject source="local">Fishery resources-- South China Sea.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b523c6b7d9d26b059bda0691b5b8539a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Economic Diplomacy: Concept and Practice in Vietnam - U.S. relations</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.083.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Phan, Phuc L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_20b02790e92ef1b120e80b8ac3d98c31">Despite its practical popularity, Economic Diplomacy (ED) has just been recently studied in academic setting. An attempt to understand what is ED leads to two questions. What is meant by 'economic' in ED and what is meant by 'diplomacy'? Answers to these questions are found the literature in the fields of international relations, economics, international political economics and diplomatic studies . Nevertheless, these fields only answer some parts of the above two questions and ED is mostly studied in multilateral relations. The paper discovers ED from a broader perspective, according to which ED is considered as a tool to serve two functions: linking economics and politics in the relations between and among states and connecting domestic and foreign policies. Despite its broad scope with this approach, the substance of ED is narrowed down in the relation with a particular bilateral partner. Illustrating this argument is the analysis of ED in the history of the
                U.S and Viet Nam relationship since 1945. This analysis is then served as the background for finding implications of how ED could contribute to solve the current issues in the two countries' relation from the perspective of Viet Nam.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_918d763ff38828ea4e17f24ede992456"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9590c53ad86d0817020e190183927739"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">United States--Foreign economic relations--Vietnam.</geogname><geogname source="local">Vietnam--Foreign economic relations--United States.</geogname><geogname source="local">United States--Foreign relations--Vietnam.</geogname><geogname source="local">Vietnam--Foreign relations--United States.</geogname><subject source="local">MA thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Diplomacy--Economic aspects.</subject><subject source="local">International economic relations.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cf0a0bfcfb20eb21f5ca7bdba9961d72" level="item"><did><unittitle>Building Sustainable Cities through International Knowledge Sharing and Multilevel Governance for Environmentally Sustainable Development: A Blue Print for Mumbai</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.083.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mistry, Niyash K.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d57b75785017384f489d5d160ea75de4">This paper lays out a possible framework by which Mumbai can achieve sustainable urban development.

However, Malaysia has not moved up the value chain and remains a middle-income country. This paper aims to identify key challenges for Malaysia and analyzes the government policy towards cluster development. In order to examine the nature of clusters, the analysis focuses on electrical and electronics, particularly semiconductors. The electrical and electronics industry, with semiconductor cluster at its core, is the most developed industry in Malaysia in terms of value added, employment, export, and FDI. After analyzing the government policies for cluster development, the paper concludes that further coordination of stakeholders and continuous effort to develop human resource and science and technology over years are keys for Malaysia's further economic development.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7deee55283a31a604feda82f3f015838"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5b301967e7e6dcb0f711149a87fb6a56"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Malaysia--Economic policy.</geogname><geogname source="local">Malaysia--Economic conditions.</geogname><subject source="local">MA thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Industrial clusters--Malaysia.</subject><subject source="local">Economic development--Malaysia.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2756fc8118ed78b98437cf22af05fdc4" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Emergence of Kenya's Innovation and Technology Ecosystem</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.083.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sanderson, Owen M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e0687f192f08bb3d293aaa4b3af55a55">Using Nairobi's iHub co-working space as a case study, Owen Sanderson explores Kenya's emerging innovation and technology ecosystem and considers its early stage efficacy.

To achieve this the paper concentrates on a group of stateless people, the Palestinian refugees; specifically the Palestinian refugees from Syria. An assessment of the adequacy of the legal protection available to Palestinian refugees is explored, looking at their history since they left Palestine and how they have been treated. This leads to a through examination of the situation of the Palestinian refugees from Syria fleeing the conflict. The aim of this paper is to highlight the plight of Palestinian refugees from Syria and the situation that they find themselves in as they attempt to flee the conflict, as well as to suggest how UN refugee agencies should better respond to this secondary forced displacement of Palestinian refugees from Syria.This case highlights a protection gap faced by stateless people in the refugee

I use Analysis of Competing Hypothesis (ACH) to test whether AQIM is more of a national or international threat based on its locus of operations and targeting. Insights derived from this quantitative and qualitative analysis will show that AQIM is an internationally oriented movement, influenced by the tactics of Al Qaeda, but that the group's ability to operate outside of its current geographic area is severely limited and it is essentially in 'survival mode.' I use Social Networks Analysis (SNA) to assess and visualize the group's current ties with other Islamist groups
                (within Africa and internationally) to show that all AQIM's former African affiliates are now aligned with ISIS, which will likely be an influencing factor in AQIM's calculus of whether or not they should remain loyal to Al Qaeda. The historical analysis, combined with the data on AQIM's more recent activities, illuminates a cyclical pattern, now midway through its third rotation, of Islamists going abroad to fight the jihad then returning to Algeria with new skills, increasingly extreme ideology, and international ties. Understanding this pattern will point to projections for the group's future.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_444c6b76facfbfd574f6a0e7a6b80689"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_affe980c4bf7652ab35c6f2ce24d1bf2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Islamic fundamentalism--Algeria.</subject><corpname source="local">Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_72d0fa503914be1773855745b566ea84" level="item"><did><unittitle>Mass Atrocity Prevention in the Twenty-First Century: Assessing the Risk for Violence in Burundi and Examining Options for US Government Policy</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.083.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Collman, Sarah L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3dfd77c61fc746e10165cdbea67616a3">This paper seeks to accomplish three goals. Firstly, it will provide a historical review of Burundi's major episodes of mass violence and an analysis identifying the patterns and trends of violence, as well as conditions that were present that allowed for mass atrocities to be committed. Secondly, this paper will discuss the evolution of risk assessment and early warning systems and tools available to policymakers to prevent and respond to mass atrocities. Part Two will also address the creation of the Obama Administration's Atrocities Prevention Board and what that entails concerning an atrocity prevention policy. Lastly, the potential for violence or atrocities in Burundi today will be considered, in the context of the country's previous episodes of mass violence and recent developments ahead of the 2015 presidential election which be held on June 26. This paper will also examine the US government's prevention efforts in Burundi.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_935c57d28860640ad44996896dc29789"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_af96f4770fd4a7438ae4cffa8695ec83"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Burundi--Politics and government--21st century.</geogname><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Atrocities--Burundi.</subject><subject source="local">Atrocities--Risk assessment.</subject><subject source="local">Atrocities--Prevention--Government policy--United States.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cd3229ccd15b3dee89eb7c18487f0f2c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Enabling Others to Win in a Complex World: Security Force Assistance and the Future of the Regionally Aligned Forces Mission in the Brigade Combat Team</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.083.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Walsh, Liam P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_89224499d1e821f04cfaf275f0fba303">As the U.S. Army looks to work in conflict prevention, the 2013 decision to align its major combat forces with a Geographic Combatant Command in the Regionally Aligned Forces concept serves as a groundbreaking new way to employ conventional Army forces.

This dubious preeminence was embodied not only in size, but also in complexity. This study seeks to demystify the gargantuan default and how it could have been avoided. Many theories exist about this debacle; from the jet-setting lifestyle of automotive company Management to the 'Mafioso' leadership style of its now incarcerated Mayor. Could the underlying source of Detroit's misfortunes be a result of the bad bets made on interest rates on the advice of financial advisors? The short answer is yes, in part, the interest rate swaps entered into by Detroit on their general-purpose bond issues might have been the straw that broke the camel's back.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d06ce1127864185feb3e08a92d62f191"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_516c2d9edd7cfd908c36d1c24dde97af"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Masters of International Business at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MIB thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Derivative securities.</subject><subject source="local">Bankruptcy--Michigan--Detroit.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3745a11a823d07bb93421d051ad69ab8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Terrorism and Freedom of Expression: An Econometric Analysis</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.083.00015</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lin, Wah-Kwan</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2944464f29da76896db30ced96f07f96">We apply empirical methods to examine the relationship between the frequency of terrorist incidences and freedom of expression, which we measure using Freedom House's Freedom of the Press report, and access to landline telephones, mobile phones, and the Internet.

This paper seeks to understand the degree to which international law in the form of the Palermo Protocol affects and shapes state behavior. The first section compares the existing theories of compliance for state behavior with international law. The second section analyzes the Trafficking Protocol as an international legal instrument, considering both its writers' intent and inherent weaknesses. The third section uses China and India as test cases, assessing the degree of their compliance with each provision of the treaty. The final section reflects back on the theory to understand why China and India willingly abide by
                certain provisions of the treaty, while disregarding other aspects. This paper concludes that international law is exerting some form of compliance pull on both countries in their evolving treatment of human trafficking as a crime. However, this compliance arises from unique reasons rooted in their forms of government and different types of societal pressures.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a0f4b2b6d11f95a41a39d4291c0212d2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c1bcc04de0fd0be202ad87324c144597"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis.</subject><subject source="local">Human trafficking (International law)</subject><subject source="local">Human trafficking--India.</subject><subject source="local">Human trafficking--China.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2b23d93cffe04b9917d3a08bd234a44c" level="item"><did><unittitle>How Do Internally Displaced Women Respond to their Own Situations?

One outcome of this debate was the Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911. The constitutionalists' attempts to establish a modern governance system relied on greater participation and support by women in the public sphere. The participation of women in the Constitutional Revolution gave them, for the first time on a large scale, the experience in organizing themselves to demand an expansion of rights and opportunities available to women.

After the failure of Iraq and Syria to resist ISIS and the latter's control over vast areas, Kurdistan too became under threat and the only effective force that came to its defense was the Peshmerga. This relative success of the Peshmerga has raised their profile internationally 1 as the only effective force on the ground fighting ISIS. While ISIS is becoming stronger due to the U.S. weapons it takes from Iraq, the support for the Peshmerga is limited and burdened because of concerns of an independent Kurdistan. There is need for further understanding of the Peshmerga and why the U.S. should provide a more direct and stronger form of support and cooperation. Not only with the objective of defeating ISIS, but also for the long term strategic security partnership and the protection of Kurdistan as an island of

Abstract: Ministers of 142 countries and customs territories gathered in Doha, Qatar on 9-14 November 2001 for the 4th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The objective was to set the agenda for a new trade round further liberalizing international trade and strengthening the multilateral trade-body.Two years ago in 1999 the delegates failed to agree on the launch of a new round at the 3rd Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Seattle, USA. The failure caused growing fear about the international community's ability to find consensus on multilateral economic policy matters and ultimately creating concern about the stability of the world economy's framework. However two years later WTO members could reach consensus on the agenda for a new trade round. Starting from this puzzling fact that countries could find agreement about issues they could not even discuss two years earlier, the Thesis intends to come up with reasons explaining the changes leading to such an outcome as well as carefully studying in details the negotiations in Doha. Before entering the subject, the methodology chosen shall be explained. The author uses the 'two-level game' framework to bring light in the paper's topic.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Trade</subject><corpname source="local">World Trade Organization</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5a0ee087966b2f5194142c6bc9b3cf33" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Forty Year Crisis Berlin (1948-1989)</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cosson-Schere, Daniele</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_03da0b469c0e8a843b32bce5db8b8d02"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_497ae010967912d6c0e1adf2d08ddb5a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Armchair specialists, in their ivory towers, may believe that the rolling Berlin crisis of the period 1958-1961 severely stretched the normal usage of the term. This paper argues on the contrary that Berlin was far more than a constant irritation for Moscow. A pawn in the Cold War balance of powers, it caused nightmares for several decade in the major Western capitals, but also guaranteed the post WWII status quo. Berlin holds a valid claim to be regarded as the seat of the longest crisis of the Cold War. The Berlin crisis was only really over once the wall fell down.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Cold War</subject><subject source="local">Crisis Management</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6fc595110519bb60812cd2b06cf64da2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Back Channel Diplomacy: The Strategic Use of Multiple Channels of Negotiation in Middle East Peacemaking</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wanis-St.John, Anthony</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2002/2002">2002</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ac4726e7b54b9ab6b8bab6429c3f0fa9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9992849495a94d20d5b52d002dcd4280"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Back channel diplomacy (BCD) refers to official negotiations conducted in secret among the parties to a dispute or even between a party and a third party intervenor, which complement front channels, and are potentially at variance with declared policies. Aspects of secrecy in negotiation have been the subject of descriptive and prescriptive literature. Research specifically focused on the strategic interaction of multiple channels of international negotiation-front and back channels-did not exist.  In this study, the cases of Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations from 1991 to 1998 are rigorously analyzed according to a theoretical framework designed to understand what BCD is, and how it works. This helps us understand why decisionmakers choose to use it. The framework looks at the treatment of the issues negotiated, the role of secrecy, the exclusion of subparties that results from secrecy, the role of third party intervenors, the proximity of decisionmakers to the negotiators, and the strategic interaction of multiple channels (front and back). The overarching condition is that of incrementalist peace negotiations, which proceed from early agreements on principles, to interim accords and finally to a permanent settlement.Decision makers use BCD to mitigate a set of uncertainties that affect many negotiations, but which particularly salient for negotiations in violent international conflicts. The uncertainties regard the i) cost of entry into negotiations, ii) effect of spoilers in the peace process, iii) the lack of information on other parties, interests and preferences that is needed to make the decision to negotiate, and iv) impact of negotiation outcome on the decisionmakers.  In helping to manage these uncertainties, BCD is associated with the achievement of early breakthrough agreements where front channels fail. However, under the condition of the incrementalist peace process requiring progressively more difficult implementation, BCD's inherent qualities of secrecy and the consequent exclusion turn problematic. The ability of decisionmakers to conclude accords before spoilers can mobilize against them is progressively diminished, until BCD no longer helps the parties reach agreement, but becomes a substitute for good faith negotiation and ultimately, yields negative returns. The potential exists for renewal of violent conflict.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d7e71fffa9946751f9704a9b35f4595e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Digital Deutschland: The Effects of Telecommunications Reform on the Internet in Germany</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bennion, Julie A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c1f0e0b3874d374133c67a30d4453cca"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5d386cd145b129d4530343b2b1e61b1f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper focuses on aspects of the German telecommunications landscape which affect the use of the Internet, and through this, Germany's ability to reach its goal of leadership in the Information Society in Europe. Telecommunications are key to the transformation to an Internet Economy, affecting both the availability and quality of services. The first section deals with the German government's ongoing reforms to open the communications market. We start with the process of liberalization, including changes in the telecommunications law, and the privatization of the national PTT monopoly, Deutsche Telekom, and its ISP subsidiary T-Online. We continue with a look at new competitive carriers for a variety of services, and include explorations of ISDN, DSL, and cable technologies as ways to bring broadband Internet access to more Germans. We will see how the introduction of competition into the German telecom market has affected telecommunications costs including Internet access costs. Flat-rate Internet access pricing is of particular interest, and we will see if this pricing can encourage Internet use. Also discussed is the ability for the Internet economy to help alleviate unemployment, expectations for which are a major push behind German policy toward the Internet.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Internet</subject><subject source="local">Telecommunications</subject><subject source="local">Deutsche Telekom</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b8a1e4d57434b5af77ac4f4efc6ad177" level="item"><did><unittitle>Development and Conflict Resolution: A Social Capital Approach to Post-Conflict Redevelopment</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dixon, Lawrence G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_976bc3d24120f5300b94c7cbba1c1f0a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b1e3c75ad024b79785c57e6d8f20114c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper presents an approach for integrating conflict resolution with development by making use of a better understanding of social capital. Development is reviewed and argued to be rooted in colonialism, and as such has serious limitations which hinder its overall effectiveness for civil society. A model of social capital is constructed and explained. Then, conflict resolution is introduced and demonstrated to be trust building.  It is compared with development and is shown to complement its shortcomings. Conflict resolution as procedural infrastructure is introduced. Finally, a discussion of how development and conflict resolution fit into the social capital model is presented</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Social Networks</subject><subject source="local">Imperialism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a4514c5e728acfa4309b8abc4d2b1979" level="item"><did><unittitle>Professional Success and Political Failure: Environmental NGOs in the Palestinian Authority</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Zwirn, Michael J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d6c04a769c69469f3f6703e2294b3e81"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_62474f4a1b3a77bfc0516ae1eea9742c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This thesis explores the role of Palestinian and Palestinian-Israeli non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the development of environmental policy and sustainable development priorities in the Palestinian Authority. The thesis focuses on the experiences of environmental NGOs in two related components of state and society building: First, in their contribution to institution-building and policy-making in the environmental sector within the Palestinian Authority; second, in the larger process of expanding civil liberties, developing a functional model of participatory politics, and furthering Palestinian civil society. This paper argues that while environmental NGOs have recorded small but substantive achievements in civic education and capacity-building for environmental protection, they have largely failed in the promotion of participatory policy-making in the Palestinian Authority.  Three types of environmental NGOs are examined in the context of their relations with the Palestinian Authority: research organizations and policy centers, public awareness and education NGOs, and binational (Israeli-Palestinian) environmental NGOs. Particular attention is paid to the political conflicts over legislation to regulate NGO activities, the al-Aqsa Intifada, and the problems faced by binational NGOs in their struggle for legitimacy in the Palestinian Authority. The paper concludes with an assessment of professional successes and political failures of environmental NGOs, and an analysis of future scenarios and prerequisites for policy-making that is more inclusive of non-governmental interests.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations</subject><subject source="local">Environmental Policy</subject><subject source="local">Palestinian Arabs</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ec6d7fa78d0fb6cc30098a55073a865b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Foreign Direct Investment as a Catalyst for Human Capital Accumulation</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ramos, Arturo</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_73f3eb61e7c67b0b92538f25b7f38c3b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_d1256915cbd309e329b831469516b5c3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper explores the role that foreign direct investment (FDI) plays in accelerating the accumulation of human capital. The empirical literature has established a correlation between human capital and economic growth and recent point to anticipated economic growth leading to faster human capital accumulation. Through two distinct but related mechanisms: the signaling of faster economic growth and the introduction of skill biased production methods, FDI creates incentives for workers to pursue more education. The paper presents a cross country empirical analysis as well as case studies from Mexico and Ireland that demonstrate this link.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Investments Foreign</subject><subject source="local">Human Capital</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Labor Market</subject><subject source="local">Education</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1ea5f123db74d45810c5c15e058366ef" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act of 2000 and The International Effects of U.S. Merger Review Reform</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Battistoni, Mark</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9e57f4aee94b460d8c5d9f0c6679331f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3a1c604ca19bc051beb3295b618f4ab0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:This paper proposes that recent revisions to U.S. premerger notification thresholds under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act of 2000 are likely to spur criticism from international competition policy stakeholders; critique will only occur after a medium-term analysis of the impact of the threshold changes with respect to the globalization of business and trends in global competition policy. Some will perceive U.S. competition policy as a tool of U.S. technology policy in that the lower regulatory standards only enhance the dominant technological and economic positions of the United States vis-&amp;#x00E0;-vis her neighbors, rich and poor. And on the basis of a Spartan U.S. record of progress many international organizations and other stakeholders in economic development will grow increasingly watchful of U.S. leadership in arriving at a cooperative international competition framework.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Antitrust Law</subject><subject source="local">Globalization</subject><subject source="local">International Competition</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_619b2b44c958e38f732534ddb009bf3d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Bandwidth Trading: Market Analysis and Price Volatility Modeling</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ilardi, Filippo</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c1f4eacaa0cc4fccb12e2598fd85e45b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_416c87769cc4b42051ad7713240f19ca"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: An embryonic market for trading of bandwidth capacity is currently emerging in the United States. Bandwidth trading is forecasted to become the largest commodity market in the world. Though, many problems still remain to see bandwidth traded as electricity or gas. These range from a lack of interconnectivity among carriers to a lack of standards and accepted regulatory framework. This thesis aims at analysing the current market situation for bandwidth trading and at modeling the future behavior of bandwidth prices.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Commodity</subject><subject source="local">Exchanges</subject><subject source="local">Telecommunications</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_279d8f3244d0020fdde150542bca477f" level="item"><did><unittitle>The US policy of 'No Concessions to Terrorists': What are the pros and the cons and the implications for the US?

Abstract: The United States has been very tough on the issue of terrorism. The policy of "No concessions to terrorists" was adopted under the Reagan administration and has been since then the bottom line of the US response to the threat of terrorism. In the light of the increasing threat of the emergence of a new age of terrorism, where the motivations of terrorists are more mingled and where their willingness to commit the most violent acts becomes more threatening, there is an urgent need for governments to determine the more effective and realistic response. This thesis will try to examine the implications of this "No concessions to terrorists" policy: whether it is actually true in practice or not and if it is, how does it apply. The Bin Laden's case is a pertinent example that has witnessed the US government's determination to stick to their strict policy.  However, the latter seems to allow some exceptions in the case of hostage taking acts where the release of hostages often constitutes part of a "deal". Would this mean that the policy applies differently whether it is viewed as tactical or strategic? Still, the policy is the same as well as the use of force as an essential mean to implement it. The US government seems reluctant to adopt more flexible measures. The questions remain: what are the implications of this policy? What are the pros and the cons of such a firm position? Is there a need to frame and adapt the response to a changing and ever-increasing globalized environment? Does this mean however that the US is condemned to embrace a rigid attitude by dint of much unproductive and unexpected result? Besides, what does the phrase "No concessions to terrorists" literally imply? By definition, a concession is the act of conceding or yielding. And conversely to the common belief, a negotiation is not a concession; negotiating does not mean giving in. Therefore, the US policy does not preclude any aspect of 'negotiation' per se. The term negotiation entails an array of meanings and aspects different from the common and primary definition which suggests that a negotiation takes place when two parties at a table explicitly agree to reach a consensus based on some common interests. As a matter of fact, a negotiation between two parties occurs when each one tries to influence the other in a particular way. According to this meaning, terrorists and the US government do negotiate. Clearly, there is a room for negotiation in the US response to terrorism. Moreover, what additional elements of negotiation should be integrated in the US policy to render it more efficient? One example would be the necessity of knowing, understanding and grasping at the roots of the other party's deepest fears, motivations and expectations. Furthermore, as Clausewitz nicely puts it, "war is the continuation of politics by other means" meaning that even in times of war, governments continue to act and run politics in a similar way as in time of peace. Should this theory apply to the way the US government handles terrorist activities? If so, is negotiation doomed to play a larger part in the modeling of the US strategy?</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Hostage Negotiation</subject><subject source="local">Iran Hostage Crisis</subject><subject source="local">Bin Laden, Osama</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_60e7d292c8a3ebdc07409c6c2550e387" level="item"><did><unittitle>Using the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) as an Enforcement Mechanism for Small Countries</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Vizcaino Cevallos, Carolina</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9e0a1cffb97b6d138e01105b165659b1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_149a018ae9b6da2a719067a1a73660d0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Under the current enforcement mechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO), small countries are not able to implement effective retaliatory measures. Given their insignificant effect on world trade, the suspension of concessions ends up causing harmful effects to their welfare. As a result, small countries lack bargaining power and are not able to force their larger partners to respect their rights under the WTO system.  The following paper explore the possibility to implement cross-retaliation, --specifically the suspension of commitments under the TRIPs agreement-- in favor of small countries to overcome ineffectiveness of their retaliatory measures and increase their bargaining power in trade negotiations.  The paper includes a legal analysis and illustrates the economic implications of the alternative measure by using the case of the Banana Regime: Ecuador against the European Union.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Comparative Advantage</subject><subject source="local">Dispute resolution</subject><corpname source="local">World Trade Organization</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_150298e4084cc5910f0c692cffc8eb55" level="item"><did><unittitle>Globalization During the Yuan Dynasty Under Khubilai Khan's Rule and Lessons for Modern Globalzation Effort</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Batbold, Ariunaa</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2002/2002">2002</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d89f8a022b397536785e063416883919"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5c870543fd033952160b98e0932f9c7a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The ancient Yuan Dynasty in China was an era that witnessed a small tribal group's rise from obscurity in the steppes of Mongolia and the build up of the largest trans-continental empire at that time. Some even argue that the acceleration of economic and cultural exchanges between Europe and Asia during the Yuan Dynasty sparked the rush of global exploration efforts by various European nations, resulting in subsequent establishment of many global empires by Western colonizers. Thus, it may be said that the Mongols of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were among the pioneers in the history of human kind in initiating the process of globalization that we are witnessing today. This paper attempts to examine the strategies employed by the Mongol rulers to build and govern their vast empire by using a framework derived from the concept of globalization. In particular, the paper focuses on the effort of the first emperor of Yuan Dynasty, Khubilai, to establish the legitimacy of Mongolian.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Globalization</subject><subject source="local">Yuan Dynasty</subject><subject source="local">Mongols</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f76d56591243a10fa983e1751f6c9966" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Transnational Crime of Human Trafficking: Positing the Anti-Trafficking Framework on Human Rights</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ling, Bonny</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2002/2002">2002</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b4627e5428fa58ea84a99630c99dba1a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_58338498a349aa6e122261715d8f5daf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The purpose of this paper is threefold: to examine human trafficking as an international human rights issue; to trace the development of an international judicial and law enforcement framework that addresses it as a transnational crime; and, finally, to consider what are some of the most important elements of an effective anti-trafficking strategy at the domestic level. Where appropriate, the paper will draw upon the author's own field experiences in India. Human trafficking, especially the trafficking of women and girls for forced prostitution, is a serious problem in India and neighboring countries of Nepal and Bangladesh. Therefore, India's model of dealing with this extensive trade in women and girls for forced prostitution provides many important insights as to how a developing country can adequately respond to this challenge.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Human trafficking</subject><subject source="local">Anti-trafficking</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e5fb097c70ab9eb886f391c634c4422e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Cultural Commodity, Global Economy: What does globalization mean for the French wine business?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fetter, Joel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2002/2002">2002</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_feae7975336e45de715332b867428b03"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_8b94728762beb5f4a46b1268c2623702"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the institutional factors that lead to the collapse of interntional business deals. To develop a working framework from which to discuss this problem, the Enron promoted Dabhol Power project in Maharashtra, India will be discussed as a case study. Traditional business strategy fails to internalize the social, cultural, political and ideological dimensions of complex business transactions. A preliminary examination of the Dabhol case reveals that many of the problems that led to the inability and unwillingness of the parties involved to implement a business agreement can be explained by negotiation theory. Negotiation theory accounts for the personality of the players, asymmetrical power relations, the lack of cultural know-how, and other complex issues in the pre-negotiation, negotiation and post-negotiation phases that lend insight into why international business agreements may fail. This paper begins with a translation of the history of the Dabhol project, continues with the application of negotiation theory to analyze the problems that arose and concludes with a model that attempts to correlate factors explained by negotiation theory that collectively produce a successful international business negotiation strategy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Business</subject><subject source="local">Negotiation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cf2e9e1188b92df55cc6b589f8729513" level="item"><did><unittitle>Neoliberalism, Populism and Presidential Impeachment in Latin America</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00016</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Coslovsky, Salo Vinocur</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2002/2002">2002</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4451577108699ab7c7a41c7106f337bc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3778bdd9302d2ce8d3e45a62527fca30"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This essay explores the convergence between neoliberalism and populism that took place in Latin America during the 1990's, and suggests that the presidential impeachments that were observed in the region can be traced back to a dismissal of democratic practices that are part of both neoliberal and populist approaches, what is here called neo-authoritarianism. The historical development of neoliberalism, populism and their hybrid neo-populism are analyzed, and also their individual and joint impacts on democratic practices. The essay explores two case studies of presidential impeachment, Fernando Collor de Mello in Brazil (1990-1992), and Abdala Bucaram in Ecuador (1996-1997), concluding that while the impeachments may represent the success of institutions against neoauthoritarianism, the fact that these presidents were elected in the first place point to deeper problems in Latin America polities.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Neoliberalism</subject><subject source="local">Populism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_322348a8e84fabb42b7287c71ae02475" level="item"><did><unittitle>Determining Country Risk Premiums for Emerging Market Countries</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00017</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ades, Daniel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9fe9cbfa8c012e7634b01a709e0cbc0a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_951fad7349a769f87caa8f7873acd7ef"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: When investing in developing economies, companies and investment banks often face a difficult choice in assigning country risk premiums for their investments. While there has been a consensus that risk can be measured as the spread between a sovereign's yield and that of an equivalent maturity US Treasury bond, this analysis assumes that markets are efficient. If such an assumption is true then it demands that at every moment in time, bonds should convey all the available information in the market and provide a fair risk/return ratio for the investor. The purpose of this paper is to question this assumption, and provide insight on an alternative method for calculating sovereign risk premiums.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Sovereign Risk</subject><subject source="local">Developing Economies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_49ee1a01184835226d22dcc1708e956a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Commanding Position: GPS, Telematics, and the Dual-Use Conundrum</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00018</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bayless, Steven H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8520ef25530986df7923acb4e24d80a2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_082565864da66f1925ed683292a308a7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the single most important element of the US' dominance of the art of conventional warfare, but it will also likely become, like the internet, a key platform for the telematics revolution: the commercial exploitation of geographical data sensors, databases, computing technology and communications for "spatially aware" applications. This paper examines how commercial competition between GPS and the EU's new Galileo satellite navigation system traces the lines along which military strategy, technology innovation, and "dual use" proliferation meet; and what guiding principles might help policy makers reconcile the interests of commerce to national security.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Geopositioning Systems (GPS)</subject><subject source="local">Dual-Use Technology</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f0c57059edcc8f6793222d000ac397b5" level="item"><did><unittitle>A World Ocean Mediterranean</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00019</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Borgerson, Scott G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d398156e558f61001c7553f6a22c097d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e380d7e2f03f538e22acef25d74d12ea"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Technology is increasingly "shrinking" the world, yet we continue to accept the artificial division of the world's waters. The goal of this paper is to break this false paradigm by defining the World Ocean, and with an appreciation for current oceanic affairs, reconceptualize the earth's salt water for what it is:  a unified, interconnected body of water with universal economic, social, and military implications.  The Mediterranean Sea provides a useful case study of how human interaction has evolved previously when man has conquered oceanic space with new technologies. The World Ocean, like the Mediterranean, has evolved in terms of trade, the projection of power, and the movement of cultures and people as a maritime conduit connecting nations.  The speed and efficiency with which commercial and military ships transit the globe continue to reduce the barrier of distance, and the World Ocean can now be conceptualized in Mediterranean terms.  Viewing the World Ocean Mediterranean with a global perspective helps illuminate broad historical currents, provides valuable insight into understanding the world today, and helps identify both threats and opportunities the world will likely face in the future.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Oceans</subject><subject source="local">Geography</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c5454e158dbd648ac21918044cf0bc4b" level="item"><did><unittitle>The End of Secrecy?: Dual-Use Remote Sensing Satellite Technology and National Security Implications  A Regulatory Framework</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00020</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Freedman, Brett D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d6f8c20563b98682ff73cca99a61a65a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_24fffb71390bfb6b16195527935da3b8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of satellite imagery in the context of two emerging trends: the information revolution and an increasing level of transparency.  Through a study of the historical development of technology, international policies, and emerging tenets of space law, this study observes the burgeoning industry of satellite remote sensing systems.  The expansion of satellite imaging illustrates the diverse range of current and future applications of this technology.  Domestic and international policies are depicted in order to highlight the ad hoc nature in which the current regulatory framework has evolved.  This essay suggests that recent events, combined with the advent of high-resolution imagery available to the general public, have dramatically altered the manner in which the international community perceives the commercial remote sensing marketplace and products.  This analysis begins with an overview of remote sensing, continues with a review of policy, space law, and the marketplace, and concludes by submitting a proposal for the creation of a regulatory framework for cooperation and oversight of remote sensing satellites.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Dual-Use Technology</subject><subject source="local">Satellite Imagery</subject><subject source="local">Remote Sensing</subject><subject source="local">Legislative Oversight</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0b51902b78bfafca2b76617ee0ea865a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Keeping Biopirates at Bay: Creating a New Legal and Institutional Protection Regime for Traditional Knowledge</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00021</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Goel, Malini S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fb464d9e7fae365f332a045874c44d20"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9878605292157e69f6cb788644634230"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: It is clear that industry, with increased support from Government, is quickly establishing control over biological resources and traditional knowledge through bio-prospecting and the dominant use of the Western intellectual property systems.  Indigenous communities are increasingly losing control over their own resources and traditional knowledge to commercial exploitation by companies and other entities. International instruments as well as regional, national and local efforts have to be strengthened and re-examined in order to turn the tides.  Indigenous efforts have to become organized and centralized in order to effect change.  There needs to be significant patent law reform if change is to be real.  The collective nature of innovation and traditional knowledge must be recognized in national legislation and at international levels.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Indigenous peoples</subject><subject source="local">Biological Diversity</subject><subject source="local">Intellectual Property</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_20bb5eba947ef6cdfcb4964c63cd74c2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Sarajevo, Whence Comes They Gloom?

Abstract: This paper seeks to identify the dimensions of ethnicity and religion which led to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914.  Intertwined is the growth of nationalism in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Europe.  The paper focuses primarily on Slavic nationalism, with some attention to German, Hungarian and Turkish nationalism, as well as the confluence of Islam with Orthodox and Latin Christianity. The overarching goal is to determine what provoked individuals in Serbia and Bosnia to violence. Though the causes of the First World War were numerous and complex, ethnic and religious tensions set the machinery of war in motion.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Nationalism</subject><subject source="local">Ethnic Conflict</subject><subject source="local">World War, 1914-1918</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_de37f28e7fb029411e3dce8fde52664b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Zero-Sum Game: Armistice Negotiations in Korea, 1951-1953</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00023</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Holmes, James</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ec33287aff849eb7b3699c6e776ec006"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_f7b1813cba19e29645c41804555c7b73"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper looks at the Korean War negotiations. Most of the dimensions of negotiation theory were in play at the table in Korea.  The paper will cover the prenegotiating, preparation and negotiating phases.  The analytical framework for examining the negotiations process will include:  an overview of the Containment policy, with a view toward understanding the role of historical context in the prenegotiation and negotiation processes;  a historical overview of the Korean War and armistice negotiations; the theory of limited war; the roles of culture and ideology in shaping the parties' perceptions, and their approach to negotiation;  the characteristics of threats, and why Eisenhower's threat in 1953 appeared to be decisive where Truman had failed; and The elements of negotiating power, and how negotiating power differs from national diplomatic, economic, and military power.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Korean War, 1950-1953</subject><subject source="local">Negotiation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d33c5a9d1c33520310e9458e620e4f4f" level="item"><did><unittitle>'Getting to No': An Analysis of Failed Mediation in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (1993-2000)</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00024</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Posner, Ahsiya</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9b3ef6dd1e5e2e8e79168dfa2b785bbd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a142327f3e4e836c5b517d282f2b965c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper is a study of the failed Israeli-Palestinian peace process between 1993-2000. The author explores four main questions.  The first three questions are: 1) did the Oslo peace process (OPP) set the Israelis and Palestinians on a trajectory that "doomed" Camp David peace negotiations of July 2000 (CD2) from the start?; 2) were there problems inherent to the process and structure of CD2 that led to its failure?; and, 3) how should future mediation attempts of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict be structured in order to meet with more success?  The fourth question, however, requires further introduction.  The study of CD2 will be guided by a Provisional Framework (PF) of seven criteria set out by the author as necessary ingredients to successful peacemaking processes.  This framework was devised after consulting existing literature and scholars in the field of mediation and negotiation in general, as well as after reviewing scholarly pieces focusing on the Israel-Palestinian peace process in particular.  After using this framework to analyze CD2, conclusions will be drawn with regard to a fourth and final question: is this prioritized framework an accurate and/ or useful tool for understanding peacemaking processes?</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Arab-Israeli Conflict</subject><subject source="local">Boycott</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_981cd32a5e398a16e8f3aad51adf8b69" level="item"><did><unittitle>Media in a Society in Transition: A Case Study of Indonesia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00025</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Low, Pit Chen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d6e18ba97318b8f37b5d77c74ee97cdc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9ce246fb138e721bb51e776fd2499efb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The Indonesian media is today at a critical moment in its history. Four years after it was liberalised, issues and debates have surfaced today that will affect its long-term viability as a free press. It is time to take stock of the changes that have occurred and address the issues before it goes on an irreversible path. Like other institutions in Indonesia, the media sector is undergoing reform. The media's transformation has taken place against the backdrop of political and economic transition in Indonesia following the tumultuous events that began with the monetary crisis of late 1997, climaxing with the resignation of President Soeharto in May 1998. Since then, the media has redefined its relationship with the state and society. It has contributed to the transition and consolidation of democracy in Indonesia. How has the media in Indonesia changed? What impact does it have on Indonesia's political development and policy-making? Will the advent of the Internet as a new media bring about more democracy and development? What are the prospects for the Internet media in Indonesia? What are the issues facing the Indonesian media today? Has the free press brought about greater democracy and development in Indonesia? What lessons can be learned from the media's development in Indonesia that may have implications for other societies in transition?</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Media</subject><subject source="local">Democracy</subject><subject source="local">Internet</subject><subject source="local">Babies</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_26bf690c854c5d513685a96c47827cc7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Arab Boycott Against Israel and Its Unintended Impact on Arab Economic Welfare</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00026</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sharon, Joyce Shems</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9f49c28ff2cdb7d8742debe0b64dd448"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_d5b8689b031e12f8993fc1e730be903c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper analyzes the economic boycott imposed by the Arab world against the State of Israel to weaken the Jewish State's economy and ultimately destroy its chances of survival. While a great deal of literature exists on the topic, little research has been done regarding the costs incurred by the Arab states imposing the economic weapon against its enemy. This thesis aims to understand the self-defeating policy of intentionally distorting trade and investment patterns through the use of a boycott. The paper proposes two hypotheses: 1) The Arab policy of boycotting Israel and blacklisting non-conforming companies created an unfavorable environment for foreign direct investment in the Arab world and 2) the boycott led to worsening terms of trade and a reduction in the volume of trade of Arab countries, leading to an overall decrease in national income and economic welfare. This thesis substantiates the hypotheses proposed by drawing upon concepts of international trade and investment while also opening up questions for future research.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Arab-Israeli Conflict</subject><subject source="local">Boycott</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1eca330118def0baa241c24e726834b6" level="item"><did><unittitle>Humanitarian Daily Rations: A Decade of Experience and New Directions</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00027</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sklaver, Benjamin A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7a95c035fe3e4e9c6011598f63d1cb6f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a4efeaf72b2c4beb00c1f8e068e72a70"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Between 1993 and 2003, the U.S. government distributed over thirteen million Humanitarian Daily Rations (HDRs) around the world. This paper will discuss the government's original goals for the HDR program, explore the needs of HDR recipients, evaluate the effectiveness of the product, and propose improvements by including non-food items in HDR packets. The HDRs could also be tailored to needs in different regions of the world. Regionally considerate rations could be useful in the media war that accompanies modern conflict. Improvements will not only make for a better product for recipients, but will demonstrate to the American people that the HDR is the best, most cost-effective ready-to-eat humanitarian product that the U.S. government can provide.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Complex Emergencies</subject><subject source="local">Nutrition</subject><subject source="local">Military</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d7bf5e7972e296edb267807455c21e72" level="item"><did><unittitle>Interest Groups, Corruption and the Role of Democracy: Effects on Trade Policy</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00028</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Abraham, David</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_194ca1e9cfd1dce2fa20a8b878a1a738"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e8daa560ebc3d07caa0744ef6b6a6171"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: As the United States and multilateral institutions concurrently push both free trade and democracy on developing nations, questions emerge regarding the viability of advocating potentially divergent policies.  Does free trade facilitate democracy? Or does democracy facilitate free trade? Can free trade and democracy be advanced simultaneously?  This paper examines the effects of interest groups and corruption on free trade and the role of democracy in enabling individuals to influence and distort trade policy.  The author concludes that nations can advance both free trade and democracy and asserts that [1] Corruption and interest groups distort trade policies and current indices fail to calculate these effects; [2] There is need for a new system to address the effects of nontariff barriers on economic welfare and a greater role for the WTO in reducing these distortions; and [3] Without civil capacity building efforts and greater government "autonomy", developing countries will have even more distorted trade policies and possibly political instability.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Trade Policy</subject><subject source="local">Democracy</subject><subject source="local">Free Trade</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_88ca230cd91c6f9b860b750be0d2ed9c" level="item"><did><unittitle>International Environmental Governance</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00029</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Christopoulou, Ioli</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a42ee0a075b17134a92a08530369adde"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7f467d856a1ad3fbf4be7970ea4ec719"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The potential for a systemic failure of the natural cycles that support human activities has resulted in the development of international environmental law. States, responding to calls for international cooperation, have concluded several hundred bilateral and multilateral environmental agreements. Paradoxically, scientific evidence continues to present alarming trends of environmental degradation, while choices of economic development continue to imperil the human well-being. Through an examination of efforts to create an international system of governance, this study demonstrates that the institutional arrangement for the promotion of sustainable development has failed to mitigate the crisis that is threatening the future of the planet.  The study identifies four causal factors: [1] compliance with international environmental law is weak; [2] protocols to conventions fall short of the broad objectives of environmental regimes; [3] provisions of regimes are duplicated or can contradict one another; and [4] environmental regimes fail to reflect complex natural cycles in order to explain the prevalent paradox.  Applying the observations of regime theory, this study emphasizes the need for the creation of an integrated system of international environmental governance.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Environmental Law</subject><subject source="local">International Institutions</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4b113a6e641e0374efaabc2d5e361475" level="item"><did><unittitle>The New Eastern Question for the European Union: What to Do About Turkey</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00030</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Perese, Alan</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1c1552f36f4425c2daa6b349ed46852a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c981da2b593d15c571819aadf4b20fec"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Ten mostly Eastern and Central European countries will enter the European Union in 2004, extending its eastern boundaries all the way to Russia and dramatically altering the landscape of the EU.  Now, the EU must deal with a new "Eastern Question," namely the potential entry of EU candidate Turkey.  It is clearly in Europe's interest to see Turkey aligned with the West and to ensure that it becomes a democratic, constitutional state for the sake of peace, stability and security in the Eastern Mediterranean, but extending membership to this predominately Muslim state requires the European Union to expand its conception of identity and revise its future vision of Europe, a move many EU members seem unprepared to accept.  Turkey's resolve to meet EU entry requirements has grown, the country has shown an ability to evolve, mature and, above all else, demonstrate that it is both resolved to and able to meet EU entry requirements. The real question then is whether Turkey will ever be allowed to enter the European Union.  This paper examines questions faced by the EU as it attempts to grapple with a near doubling of the number of members in the Union and the major obstacles that Turkey will face in trying to gain entry to the EU, using Poland's experience of five years of negotiations with the EU as a comparison. The paper concludes with a look to the future and each country's probable position within the EU sphere in the years ahead.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">European Union</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_074247cf1eca0ec66d9421ba03da8a95" level="item"><did><unittitle>Possibilities for Promoting Global Education in Japan</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00031</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ushida, Mayako</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a7e24019da8f152f7c7e7593dd2e1e14"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_78fac8170e91061cf30e4272edba3c65"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper investigates the possibilities for promoting Global Education (GE) in Japan.  The first section attempts to gain a clear picture of GE in its international and Japanese contexts, its history and development, and its current practices.  The obstacles to practicing GE in Japan are also examined.  The second section considers the history and development of Education for International Understanding in its international context, as well as its history and practice in elementary, junior high, and high schools in Japan.  Using interviews and the results of a survey that included 403 elementary, junior high, and high school level teachers in Japan, the third section examines the attitudes of teachers toward GE.  The specific questions addressed in this section include the teachers' level of interest in GE issues, the classroom practice of GE and the reasons for this, the obstacles they face in practicing GE, and what kind of support they need.  The paper concludes with recommendations for supporting teachers who have practiced GE and who want to practice GE and for GE promoters (e.g. Educational NGOs and other organizations) who can respond to some of the needs of teachers in teaching GE.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Education</subject><subject source="local">International Education</subject><subject source="local">Global Education</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_768c1c058188a941e69e6b24d4fa2475" level="item"><did><unittitle>Unconventional Warfare as a Strategic Foreign Policy Tool: The Clinton Administration in Iraq and Afghanistan</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00032</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Linnington, Abigail Thompson</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2434cc8e6b4f7e483885ae3ca8a13ed4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_320c89f6be8c54e2ea59a4b17f5cb3e0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: While there is much literature on the operational and tactical military histories of U.S. Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) within security studies, little analysis exists of their primary mission, unconventional warfare (UW), and its implementation within a greater national security strategy. As the primary and founding mission of Army SOF, UW receives scant attention as a tool of American foreign policy that supports our national interest. This paper assesses U.S. unconventional warfare strategies employed during the 1990s in Iraq and Afghanistan and concludes that the United State ineffectively utilized UW as a strategic foreign policy tool in those two instances. It begins with a brief history of the development of UW doctrine, UW institutionalization within Army SOF, and the integration of SOF and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for UW operations. The Clinton Administration's decision to implement UW with limited CIA assets is analyzed using prospect theory - a theory of decision-making under risk. The Administration's strategic objectives, while sound, were diminished by the president's lack of commitment to foreign policy, aversion to military solutions, and turbulent domestic politics. In the cases of Iraq and Afghanistan, the president considered four foreign policy options, settling on limited UW. Operating in the domain of losses, President Clinton pursued risk prone behavior by intervening within a hostile state despite risk averse tendencies resulting from past military failures. Ultimately, the decision to implement a limited, disjointed UW campaign outside a greater national strategy contributed to mission ineptitude. Ultimately, further comprehensive strategic analysis is necessary to ensure that the lessons learned from past U.S. successes and failures inform better use of UW assets as an asymmetrical fighting force against like-minded U.S. opponents.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Unconventional warfare</subject><subject source="local">Special forces(Military science)</subject><subject source="local">Covert operations</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7d93e2260e10bfa168b953a8b47ab981" level="item"><did><unittitle>Transatlantic Relations: A Study in Complementarity</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00033</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Goh, Dominic</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5a79af508de102e17ced87a2edf5c03b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_1c9d9aa53e5b669738ba00bb9ebea2e2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Many commentators and policy makers have referred to the complementary nature of transatlantic relations.  This paper examines the concept of complementarity in more detail and demonstrates that complementarity can be viewed on four levels: 1. Interpersonal complementarity: Psychological studies have shown that people react to behavioural stimuli in certain fixed ways.  For example, friendly behaviour evokes friendliness, and hostility begets hostility.  This Interpersonal Principle of Complementarity can be applied to the transatlantic relationship to demonstrate the US needs to treat Europe as an equal if it wants to obtain European assistance. 2. Power-Law complementarity: The US, as the world's leading democracy, needs international legitimacy to act militarily.  By working closely with Europe, the US is more likely to find that its actions are viewed as legitimate. 3. Supplemental complementarity: This is what most commentators refer to when they speak of complementarity.  The issue is how the US and EU can cooperate by bringing their respective strengths into a particular operation.  In most cases, the US will take the lead in the military operation, while the EU will take the lead in the peacekeeping and civil reconstruction phase. 4. Oppositional complementarity: Opposition is not usually thought of when speaking of complementarity.  Nevertheless, complementarity can encompass oppositional as well as supplemental relationships.  In the transatlantic context, it is important to manage the relationship such that cooperation is maximised, while opposition is minimised. After setting out the conceptual framework, the paper considers several cases since the end of the Cold War to show how the framework might work in practice.  The cases considered are Bosnia, Kosovo, the Middle East Peace Process, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  The cases demonstrate the validity of the above framework and the continued relevance of NATO as the primary vehicle for promoting transatlantic complementarity.  However, as NATO does not include the EU in its formal structures, the paper concludes by showing that there is a growing need for an institutional mechanism to bring together the three key elements of the transatlantic relationship-- the US, the EU and NATO.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Transatlantic</subject><subject source="local">NATO</subject><subject source="local">European Union</subject><subject source="local">complementarity</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9a59414f861aa7514d02e71d2f520a12" level="item"><did><unittitle>Ubudehe and the Kecamatan Development Projects: Case Study and Comparative Analysis</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00034</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dunbar, Judith Scott</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1d11951a1e68d02d3782a55cc6ad28af"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_41595f970d541395f860ef3181eac73b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Donors have developed a number of different approaches to support decentralization, including grant programs for public infrastructure and community development planning.  Such programs are designed both to build local officials capacity to govern, and to build the community's capacity to set its own priorities and design its own development solutions.  Two such programs are the Ubudehe process in Rwanda, and the World Bank Kecamatan Development Projects (KDP I, II and III) in Indonesia. Both programs provide grants to local level government to help support a government-sponsored decentralization effort, and to help build community capacity through participatory development planning.  The paper finds that while the programs have different contexts, funding and mandates, they faced similar challenges.  This paper analyzes these programs based on project documents and evaluations.  Costs and benefits of each program are examined in light of the major obstacles they face.  The final section of the paper compares the two programs, and draws out the major lessons learned, including differences in context, mandate, financial structure, funding and anti-corruption strategies.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Grant programs</subject><subject source="local">decentralization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_da611673cc2114d2c16d05eb50aaec3d" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Hispanic Paradigm: to acculturate or not to acculturate?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00035</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Comenge, Alberto</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c49cac0a36d612836b60c10d3d568502"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3b21c3d577ba115ad11069e0e2cffd6c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The aim of this thesis is to investigate the process of acculturation of minorities into American mainstream culture, providing a framework that analyzes the most important factors that influence the process of acculturation. The minority analyzed throughout the research is the Hispanic community because of two main reasons. The first reason is the controversial arguments published recently by Samuel Huntington that alert that Hispanics, especially Mexican-Hispanics, do not acculturate into American culture, which could potentially fragment U.S. culture for the first time in its history. The second reason why I have decided to prove these factors of acculturation in Hispanics is because it is the largest minority in the United States since 2002, with the high probability of becoming the second largest concentration of Hispanics in the world in less than ten years and the eighth largest purchasing economy in the world, ahead of Canada by 2007. Once understood all the factors and differences that affect the acculturation of Hispanics, the ending chapter will be dedicated to understand the marketing implications derived from the emergence of this minority, understanding how to segment most efficiently and analyzing within each segment different consumer behaviors, media consumption and more efficient ways to target and understand this important and growing segment of the U.S. population.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">Hispanics</subject><subject source="local">acculturation</subject><subject source="local">assimilation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_52dcf0d008e479721d071e8520746f6e" level="item"><did><unittitle>AIDS in Africa: A Security Threat?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00036</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">White, Elizabeth Hadley</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b820c054a5391916990a4aa37618129c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3e8a81521b80d6a876e0c2f0fc9e54c0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Can a disease constitute a security threat?  In 2000 the National Intelligence Council first identified HIV/AIDS as a threat, not only to Africa, but to the United States.  This paper explores this shift from national to human security concerns and analyzes how AIDS is capable of severely impacting state structures in Africa.  If AIDS is not contained in Africa in the near future, the real possibility exists of state instability and failure occurring throughout the continent.  This will affect the United States on many fronts, including its national security interests.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">HIV</subject><subject source="local">AIDS</subject><subject source="local">Security</subject><subject source="local">Threat</subject><subject source="local">Public Health</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2bc3c4c7341b63c6d87fae6d46960aea" level="item"><did><unittitle>Rice Trade Issues between Japan and Thailand</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00037</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chantadansuwan, Sittikorn</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a92732be67c0e6070eab22c2c9e6b73c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_40fac37b5303493d82ed659054ecf1d2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Thailand, the largest rice exporting country in the world , had expected new rice market opportunities when the Japanese market was liberalized by the Uruguay Round.  However, Thailand was unsatisfied with the Japanese rice market access, claiming that the Japanese rice import regime lacked transparency.  In particular, Thailand argued that Japan used de facto country specific quotas to determine the in-tariff quota in its minimum access regime.  The alleged "country specific quota" prevented Thailand from attaining a market share in the Japanese import rice market, as it should have been able to do.  Is the allegation above warranted?  Was the Japanese rice import regime in 2001 -- the so-called minimum access regime -- legal under the World Trade Organization (WTO) law?  This thesis purports to examine this claim under the WTO legal order of which Japan and Thailand are Members.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commerical Policies</subject><subject source="local">International Business and Economic Law</subject><subject source="local">Rice</subject><subject source="local">Trade</subject><corpname source="local">SBS</corpname><corpname source="local">World Trade Organization</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9f0c52a9a234f8e22cf2dab4d409ef3d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Internatioinal Aid and Democratic Building Process: Cambodia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00038</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Van, Tooch</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8aa721008b65bf9f5bde7e341ee2cc81"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7bd7097be705caf18512284a441f9cfc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: In a 1996 report, Geetha Nagarajan remarked that "studies on the consequences of conflicts on the development of financial markets and on issues concerning the design and implementation of financial programmes in post-conflict countries are very limited. In short, issues regarding the development of financial institutions in conflict-affected countries are emerging topics of interest on which there has been little research and even less published."   An increasing amount of research on how to do microfinance in post-armed conflict environments has occurred in the ensuing eight years, though little writing links this work to the broader discourse on the development-conflict nexus and the growing international momentum toward conflict-sensitive programming.  Moreover, the predominant focus among microfinance researchers is on how conflict impacts microfinance; no writing seems to address how microfinance impacts conflict. This thesis attempts to bridge this gap by proposing three ways in which the mobilization of microcredit could, in itself, dampen conflict tensions and reduce the potential for escalation toward open violence.  These three mechanisms, termed "direct", "indirect", and "process" mitigation, evolved out of field research instigated at the request of a small credit union in rural Cameroon to examine the links between credit and conflict.  These mechanisms, or typology, form the conceptual heart of this thesis.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">Microfinance.</subject><subject source="local">microcredit</subject><subject source="local">Conflict</subject><subject source="local">conflict sensitivity</subject><subject source="local">Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e81b9c131ef0bd6bc60203f52937f33b" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Environmental, Technical and Economic Implications of the White Spot Syndrome Virus on Latin American Shrimp Farming</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00040</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">McClennen, Caleb</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9b4138b19e64b23e772c38adefa28669"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6b86d8351709da4be6812a27683c8ad2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: In the past twenty years, export oriented shrimp farming in Latin America and throughout the world has boomed, diversifying national trade, while providing a much needed boost to poor coastal economies.  The industry is praised from within, while emphatically lambasted by many international activists who cite the destruction of mangrove ecosystems and coastal fisheries, gains in the hands of a few and politically corrupt structures guiding an ultimately unsustainable extractive industry.  In 1999, the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) epizootic quickly spread through nine Pacific coast Latin American countries, costing billions of dollars in regional export earnings of which most  of the economies have yet to recover.  However, in all countries, university scientists, farm owners and technicians, NGOs and international development agencies are working on solution to survive with WSSV.  This investigation first seeks to account for the short term devastation of the disease, and then examines its long-term effects on the sustainability, both ecologically and economically, of the Latin American shrimp farming industry.  Sustainability is examined by analysis of the economic, technical, legal and environmental changes that can be attributed to the disease shock.  Data and research was gathered through government and NGO reports and analysis, industry publications and numerous interviews through coastal Peru, Ecuador and Mexico.  The experiences of these three countries are explored as representative case studies of the region.  It is concluded that on average the disease has left the industry, though crippled, an ecologically more sound, legally more controlled, politically more integrated and overall more sustainable structure than in the past.  The massive profits wrought from the low control and hastily planned boom days of the 1980s and 1990s are those of the past.  The WSSV has accelerated existing industry trends towards efficiency and scientific understanding to increase profits and survive future challenges while simultaneously decreasing negative externalities.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Environment and Resource Policy</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Shrimp Farming</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject><subject source="local">Environmental Policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9978dca1f508ae3ee214917caa93ad75" level="item"><did><unittitle>Legal reform and economic development in Vietnam and China: a comparative analysis</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00041</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Day, Adam C</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f4efa6a55531f571855096af1748c926"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_0a2ae49457d2ae37045d2ef085a7a33a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract:  One of the reasons that law enforcement agencies have been frustrated in their attempts to curb the flow of terrorist finances is that they are using old weapons to fight a new war. The framework of multilateral agreements, financial industry regulations, and domestic laws around the world that tackle money laundering were written largely during the 1980s to fight the War on Drugs, but are ill-equipped to fight the War on Terrorism.  This paper explores the origins and characteristics of the global anti-money laundering regime, and why al Qaeda has been able to exploit numerous weaknesses in that regime.  This paper also proposes a set of recommendations that law enforcement agencies and financial institutions should adopt, in order to adapt to the new threats posed to the global anti-money laundering regime by terrorist financing.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Business and Economic Law</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Terrorist Financing</subject><subject source="local">Money Laundering</subject><subject source="local">Global Anti-Money Laundering Regime</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_aad260ca80e3c17e251dccecba20dfaf" level="item"><did><unittitle>Replacing Narco-usurers with Micro-lenders: Agricultural Finance Component of Opium Substitution Programs in Afghanistan</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00046</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Anand, Bhuvana</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_df849cabd6abbea8df758843402e7539"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4795fe1bd67ae12a35be55197b1519a6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Most of the focus in the opium substitution and eradication effort in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban has been on the development of alternative crops and enforcement of the ban issued by the interim administration. Program managers and researchers are focusing on the price dynamic influencing farmers decisions to cultivate opium, while underemphasizing the credit arrangements developed by narco-traders to incentivize opium cultivation. In the absence of access to other credit sources, small farmers find it especially difficult to resist the possibility of obtaining advances from narco-usurers for the opium crop before planting season. This paper argues that in the absence of effective control on factors influencing demand and prices for opium, the interim administration, NGOs, and donors should focus their attention on factors that influence farmers' decisions to cultivate poppy. Primary among these factors is the availability of credit, since is integral to coping strategies especially for smaller households. Providing alternative agricultural financing mechanisms and programs can be one of the strategies employed by international organizations and NGO's to divert production away from opium, especially in newer opium-growing regions. Designing these programs involves understanding of best practices in agricultural financing, Islamic financing, and administrative constraints in the Afghan environment. This paper analyses the opium credit- relationship that narco-usurers and traders have developed by exploiting the asset insecurity of Afghan households in sustaining the cultivation of opium. In response this paper recommends that agricultural micro-financing programs can play an important role in providing incentives to farmers to switch to crops other than opium, especially in the newer opium growing provinces. It finally makes recommendations about design choices, products, and administrative concerns that organizations can use while outlining their strategy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Microfinance.</subject><subject source="local">Crop substitution</subject><subject source="local">Opium</subject><subject source="local">Agricultural Credit</subject><subject source="local">Agricultural Finance</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3bb8b3063c98c9de0d88d4f711dc3bef" level="item"><did><unittitle>Carbon Sequestration and its Potential as a Market Mechanism Tool for Sustainable Development</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00047</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Minott, Nichola Diane</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6e4cdd54981cfb810c2a38b36dbb08be"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_be94e896b554163637629c5f32e18e7d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: This essay inquires into the use of coercive intervention in international affairs. International relations are structured by the realist, liberal and utopian view of the international system. Each of these theories proposes different security concepts by which international conflict can be deterred or suppressed. Their coexistence and imperfect implementation, however, creates an inadequate international system in which non-state conflicts are not efficiently engaged. Partial accountability and non-integration of international actors are the key shortcomings of this system. An excessive focus on states has created the perverted situation in which state rights dominate over human rights. These shortcomings can be remedied by a comprehensive and far-reaching set of institutional reforms at the international level. Even if an effective collective security system is being restored through reform, its efficiency relies on the credible deterrence of those actors who are capable of affecting the international system. In case of faulty behavior by these actors, the deterrent threat must be executed to uphold international peace and security. Its execution takes the form of forceful interventions, which are implemented by third parties. On the policy level, intervening actors can play a series of roles, choosing among a number of forms and modes of coercive intervention. These choices are not arbitrary but can be matched to the intensity level of the conflict that is being engaged. This matching of intervention with conflict intensity requires a delicate process in which correlations are identified and codified.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Coercion</subject><subject source="local">Deterrence</subject><subject source="local">Dayton</subject><subject source="local">Non-state actor</subject><subject source="local">International Peace and Security</subject><subject source="local">International System</subject><subject source="local">International Order</subject><subject source="local">Intervention</subject><subject source="local">Sanction</subject><subject source="local">Conflict</subject><subject source="local">Third party</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_efafca28753ac5791f0f2b4b7967dec3" level="item"><did><unittitle>Chinese-North Korean Discourse: Pathways to the Future</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00050</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sweda, John C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b74efcdd1af04b8bc66eabecaf8afbc0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_421df54a2aeeb870c4830d6bcf5ad3bd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  As the United States and North Korea has moved closer to armed confrontation over Kim Jong Il's clandestine nuclear armaments program increasing attention has been paid to the relationship between North Korea and its supposed chief ally, China.  The assumption in the international community has been that the North Koreans and the Chinese share a "lips and teeth" friendship that spans five decades.  While it is true China came to North Korea's rescue during the Korean War and that today China is North Korea's biggest economic benefactor, these two factors ignore the actual complexity of the contemporary relationship.  The central argument of this thesis will be that the current understanding of the Chinese-North Korean relationship is vastly overstated in the direction of a positive interaction and if it is reassessed, the international community would find that the two supposed "partners" are further apart than is commonly known.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Chinese-North Korean relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e9d707090835986973f2872067a1477f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Discovering Cyprus: The effects of the Opening of the Green Line on Young Greek-Cypriots and their perception of identity</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00051</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Severis, Zenon</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d32d1687f6f2156aaa9bda5b9243e558"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9650b52609d7e048f75f27178455f06a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The opening of the Green Line in April 2003 has given the opportunity to Greek-Cypriots to visit the north for the first time since the invasion of 1974. For Greek-Cypriots who were born after that time, this has been a particularly interesting experience, as it has been the first encounter with both the land in the north and with Turkish-Cypriots. Through unstructured, informal interviews, I attempt to gauge the reaction of young Greek-Cypriots to the opening of the Green Line. Many have refused to cross, but those who have done so offer fascinating insights into the perception of Otherness, and more importantly, the process of formation of Cypriot identity (Cypriotism), the development of which, in my opinion, is a vital factor in securing a peaceful and viable solution to the Cyprus Problem. Through noticing the great similarities between Turkish-Cypriots and themselves, appreciating that the dialectic of victimisation cannot be monopolised, and familiarising themselves with the land in the north of the island, the Greek-Cypriots' sense of Cypriotness appears strengthened. The ability to extend the imagined Cypriot community to include Turkish-Cypriots seems a distinct possibility. This effectively sends optimistic messages with regard to the situation that may arise when the two communities are called upon to live together in a bi-zonal, bi-communal, federal arrangement.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">Identity</subject><subject source="local">Cypriotis</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_dd27652abfd871a26054e0b2d83fee87" level="item"><did><unittitle>Business development services, unemployment and the Kenyan informal sector</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00052</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Antoine, Malick D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_40920514ffd61f5179b987106587915b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_37bb5b42220c4c812a43141b3dd58e67"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract:  Since the institutionalization of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1994, the World Trade Organization has become the drive for freer trade.  However, critics of the organization have complained that free trade had become inconsistent with fair trade, and that the WTO had in fact prevented states from fulfilling their human rights obligations.  One particular area of concern is health.  In this paper, I will analyze the nexus between WTO law and the human right to health, in an effort to identify provisions that can, in fact, assist WTO members in fulfilling their human rights obligations vis-&amp;#x00E0;-vis the right to health.  In applying those provisions, however, WTO members and the dispute settlement body have showed an inconsistent stance in health-related disputes, which coincides with the involvement and influence of political lobbies.  It is therefore essential, to guarantee a systematic application of WTO law, in a manner consistent with WTO members' human rights obligation in health, to institutionalize an interpretive approach to WTO law in light of the right to health.  Such effort can be achieved only after the relevant international human rights bodies and the NGO community stop attacking the WTO, an attitude that has proved, thus far, counterproductive, but rather collaborate with it.  This approach will not only ensure the respect for the human right to health in WTO law, but will also ensure that member states will reap the economic benefits of globalization the WTO has to offer.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Public International Law</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commerce Policies</subject><subject source="local">TRIPS</subject><subject source="local">SPS</subject><subject source="local">TBT</subject><subject source="local">Covenant on Economic</subject><subject source="local">Social and Cultural Rights</subject><subject source="local">Right to Health</subject><subject source="local">Pharmaceutcal</subject><subject source="local">EC</subject><subject source="local">Access to medicines</subject><subject source="local">Intellectual Property</subject><subject source="local">Precautionary Principle</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a86cec1fc2e9f57212c38f753a226ad5" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Impact of Economic Openness of Internet Diffusion in Estonia and Slovenia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00054</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kitsing, Meelis</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_04094725638516390e4cefa52430c141"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_048cb1cfbee32122e368fcf3da7e0264"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  The importance of facilitating increased Internet diffusion has become widely recognized by policymakers in transition and developing countries. Wider use of the Internet will foster both economic and political development. Based on the case studies of Estonia and Slovenia, this thesis proposes that the best way to encourage Internet diffusion in transition and developing economies is through the privatization of an incumbent telecom company and opening the telecom market. Securing maximum openness and fair play in the telecom sector requires the establishment of a truly independent telecom regulatory agency. Telecom regulators need to become more independent and stay free of political interventions. This thesis recommends these policies be combined with liberal trade and foreign direct investment regimes.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commerce Policies</subject><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">Internet diffusin</subject><subject source="local">Information and Communication Technologies</subject><subject source="local">Transition Economies</subject><subject source="local">Economic Reforms</subject><subject source="local">Trade Policy</subject><subject source="local">Telecommunications</subject><subject source="local">Privatization</subject><subject source="local">Foreign Direct Investments</subject><subject source="local">Regulation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bb7a60143058551f8992430346a2c2ef" level="item"><did><unittitle>Does Being Legal Matter?

Abstract:  The word 'refugee' generally conjures images of sprawling rural camps with grids of tents, families living in cramped quarters, and fences.  When one contemplates refugee hosting areas, one generally does not think of Johannesburg, Cairo, Kampala, Nairobi, Khartoum, Dar es Salaam, and New Delhi.  However, together these cities host hundreds of thousands of refugees.  Each host government is unique in the degrees to which it accepts refugees into urban areas and allows them to be social and economic actors.  In general, the norm in the Global South is one where refugees are confined to camps.  Those who migrate to urban areas, either directly from their country of origin, through other countries, or from rural settlements, often do so in violation of the host country policy.  Egypt and South Africa are unique in their lack of camp-confinement policies and their acceptance of refugees in urban areas. The fact that some refugees have government permission reside in urban areas while others do not creates a system of legal and illegal urban refugees.  Faced with limited or non-existent assistance, all of these refugees are left to their own resources in order to meet the basic needs of food and shelter and eventually move beyond a survivalist existence. This paper examines the extent to which refugees living legally in urban areas throughout the Global South face the same livelihood challenges as refugees without legal status.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Urban Refugees</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><subject source="local">Livelihood Obstacles</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5dfb2aea1ff3872a4d687f897eee67f1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Empowered Communities:  How New Communications Technologies and Applications are Enabling Communities of Influence to Form and Develop</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00056</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tunnard, Christoper (Rusty)</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3190af9cccfa41faa9715feae888e26b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7fb145e4f25321ac20457c6a906cc017"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: A question often being asked in the aftermath of the dot-com boom is: to what extent does the Internet enable communities of influence to form and develop?  Governments, NGOs, companies, and individuals are interested in what may prove to be longer-lasting value than simply commercial, or 'pre-IPO.' This paper attempts to answer this question by a considered, empirical study of what communities are and what factors or aspects of community development are particularly affected by the Internet.  Communities fall, in size and scope, somewhere between individuals and supra-national entities.  So, first, some of the literature on 'communities as proto-nations' is reviewed, as looking at nations helps frame subsequent discussions on community. Then, four main elements for community formation and development are examined:  identity and culture; communication, networks, and language; visualization; and facilitation of action.  Each is discussed in some detail, with citations from the literature, with comments about the relevance of new communications and information technologies, and discussions of relevant examples. Next, a selection of online communities, ranging in size from supra-national (The U.N. Information and Communications Task Force) to sub-national (a group of Italian schools who have joined together to write, edit, and publish a national newspaper) is presented.  Each is discussed and looked at for its relevance to community-building and the use of technology to achieve results. A technology review starts with a short description of the collapse of the 'dot-com revolution' and the spectacular declines of some of the world's largest telecommunications and media companies.   During this period, it is argued, three of the Internet's ongoing achievements and trends have been obscured:  there is sufficient infrastructure in place to allow the Internet to operate cost-effectively and to continue to grow; while the number of users has peaked in the United States and Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa are experiencing strong growth in users and in web sites; and there are a number of new or improving technologies which are making it easier than ever to communicate and form communities of common interest. The paper ends with an analysis of one community against the four main elements of community formation mentioned above.  A major conclusion is that, since many of these new technologies and applications (e.g. Instant Messenger, Internet Protocol telephony, Web logs) are being heavily used by children, it is possible to believe that the generation which is currently growing up and is comfortable with the broad array of communications and community-forming technologies, now and soon-to-be available, will have a better chance of using them to positive advantage than those currently in power.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Information and Communication</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">Internet</subject><subject source="local">Communications</subject><subject source="local">Information technology</subject><subject source="local">Communities</subject><subject source="local">Geography</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b4995aae7629452d09ad2d992f2a64a1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Riba in Islamic Jurisprudence: The Role of 'Interest' in Discourse on Law and State</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00057</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Netzer, Miriam</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ff0c97454a57b3cd2d04b34ad6ebab92"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5f9b74e413e3cd71c24139fced0299f3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The study of Islamic Finance provides a unique opportunity to examine both the evolution of Islamic legal science, and the current struggle between fundamentalist and moderate movements over the role of Shari'a law in the modern legal system of the Islamic state. Shari'a compliant financial instruments are those that do not contravene prohibitions in Islamic revelatory texts against riba, 'interest,' and gharar, 'speculation,' in business transactions.  Although making profit off loans is illicit according to the Quran, several classical jurisprudential methodologies have been employed to create financial instruments, which concur with the letter of the law, if not the spirit.  The existence of these products points to a tension between textualism and essentialism at the core of Islamic legal theory. The tendency to apply a rigid 'textualist' framework on to Shari'a law in the area of finance is countered by the growing significance of Islamic Economics, which concerns itself with wider issues of economic and social justice and permeates religious/political discourse today. The issuance of a fatwa in December 2003 by the premier institute of Sunni legal scholarship, Al-Azhar University of Cairo, permitting pre-specified fixed rate bank deposits, ignited a stormy debate whose backdrop is the 40-year struggle in the State of Egypt between proponents of positive and divine law - a debate which is being settled in the Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court.  It is with surprising tenacity that the issue of Riba inserts itself into contemporary discourse about authority and authenticity in Islam.  It is well worth an examination.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization</subject><subject source="local">International Business and Economic Law</subject><subject source="local">Islamic Finance</subject><subject source="local">Islamic Banking</subject><subject source="local">Islamic Law</subject><subject source="local">Shari'a</subject><subject source="local">Riba</subject><subject source="local">Interest</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e71b6dcd2e9d02d1e5b3953411f4e625" level="item"><did><unittitle>Warning of Terror: Explaining the Failure of Intelligence Against Terrorism</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00058</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dahl, Erik J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_49365540e3c67efd81549b9a82c67607"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_099ba8b305722f1741630b9d1791c9dc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  Many scholars have studied intelligence failure and developed theories to explain disasters such as the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Others have examined the rising threat of terrorism, and see it as posing a particularly difficult challenge for the intelligence community.  But little work has been done to integrate the earlier literature on intelligence failure with the newer threat of terrorist attack.  This thesis attempts to answer the question: How well do traditional theories of intelligence failure and strategic surprise account for the inability of the intelligence community to warn of terrorist attacks?  Three schools of thought can be found in the literatures on intelligence and on terrorism, and for each school several hypotheses will be developed and tested against a particular case study: the bombing of the U.S. Marine Barracks in Lebanon in 1983.  While the Beirut bombing does appear to confirm several of these hypotheses, none of these schools of thought will be shown to satisfactorily explain the limitations of the intelligence community in the fight against terrorism.  While the factors that produce surprise in terrorist attacks are familiar, the nature of that surprise, and the effects created, can be very different.  Instead, an alternative approach toward the study of intelligence failure will be briefly introduced.  This is what sociologist Charles Perrow has called normal accident theory.  Accident theory suggests that while traditional theories of intelligence may be sufficient to explain the causes of intelligence failure, the inevitability of that failure may arise from the complex nature of the intelligence system.  In addition, normal accident theory suggests that much of the literature on intelligence failure, which focuses on the problems caused by human perception and cognition, may be misguided and even counterproductive.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Security Studies</subject><subject source="local">Intelligence Failure</subject><subject source="local">Beirut Bombing</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Normal Accident Theory</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_93bb42b5c1c923bf04b051b868848c02" level="item"><did><unittitle>Al Qaida: The Ideology of Killing in the Name of God</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00059</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Khan, Sajid U</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1cd163e441c3344a2d8380fd21529e0b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e1d9670f05d1f405639ac0d46a0aa774"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract:  Over the last two decades, microfinance has become a popular vehicle for poverty reduction and economic development in Bangladesh.  As the microfinance industry continues to experience high growth rates, and as concern about the need to protect the poor engaged in microfinance activities increases, the question of whether and how to regulate and supervise microfinance institutions (MFIs) also grows in importance.  On May 2, 1990, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) established the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) as a not-for-profit financial apex organization.  As an apex organization, PKSF's purpose is twofold: (1) to perform financial intermediation through the distribution of collateral-free loans with concessional rates of interest, financed by development banks and international donor agencies, to its partner organizations (POs) that perform grassroots microcredit operations and (2) to develop sustainable microcredit institutions.  PKSF has several characteristics that are thought to render it a good candidate as regulator.  In Bangladesh, where access to credit is scarce and donor funds are decreasing, MFIs are obligated to comply with PKSF's strict reporting and performance standards to receive its credit.  PKSF also has extensive experience appraising, monitoring and supervising diverse MFIs.  PKSF has a highly qualified, professional staff that is trained in microfinance.  In addition, PKSF's mission statement is encourages MFI product and process innovations and the expansion of new products.  Finally, PKSF places great emphasis on building institutional development in order to strengthen its own capacity as an apex funding institution and the capacity of its POs, which promotes the sustainability of the industry.  However, there are some financial and non-financial costs that must be considered as part of this discussion.  The administrative costs of registering all MFIs under one roof could force closure of MFIs and raise interest rates, hurting more of the poor who depend on their services.  PKSF also may not be an effective regulator for local MFIs that do not receive or depend upon funds from PKSF or donor organizations for its operations.  On the other hand, the legitimacy and promotional benefits that would accrue to small locally funded MFIs may be great enough to attract funds and increase outreach to offset these initial costs.  If PKSF compliance standards can serve as a benchmark for the financial health of deposit-taking MFIs, like a credit report, confidence in the sector would be expected to increase, thereby attracting more depositors and investors than there would have been if regulation reform had not occurred. Further research and investigation into quantifying the size and weighing the potential costs and benefits of regulation reform should be considered to determine the best course for implementation.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">Microfinance.</subject><subject source="local">Regulation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_974ee6b9d75593204a07c8f8ba1a5595" level="item"><did><unittitle>FCC's Community Group-Lending: Relieving the Constraint Placed on the Institution's Poverty Alleviation Impact by Program Design Weakness</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00061</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Isen, Jeffrey A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_711d3e7bfbaf1a8c56c8535cf0757786"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_02e9c2858e3865519e4ff02b03f03360"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  Fundo de Cr&amp;#x00E0;dito Comunit&amp;#x00E1;rio (FCC) is one of the largest microfinance providers in Mozambique, serving more clients than any other institution in the  nation.  About 85% of its client portfolio is engaged in their community group-lending program.  Unfortunately, many intra-group delinquencies are occurring, leaving clients to select between one of two costly coping strategies.  First, many non-delinquent clients have to use profits or savings to cover the repayments of delinquent group members; this necessarily constrains the net benefit that they are able to realize from borrowing, and may produce a net cost.  Second, other non-delinquent clients, in order to avoid ensuring this cost, have resorted to forcefully confiscating the personal possessions of delinquent group members in order to cover their repayment.  This leaves the latter clients worse off for having borrowed credits from FCC.  This thesis provides two possible explanations for the sub-optimal performance of FCC's poverty alleviation impact.  First, in light of the careful examination of the necessary components that any group-lending scheme must possess, the study argues that FCC's community borrowing group structure is not always conducive to the effective exploitation of necessary group-lending mechanisms (informational advantage, peer-monitoring/pressure, and informal insurance).  This inhibits clients' ability to mitigate the costs of borrower delinquency.  Second, relying on data gathered during a market research campaign, it is argued that the loan terms are proving to be too onerous for borrowers, causing delinquencies that force other clients to adopt costly coping strategies.  Policy reform recommendation are then offered to assist FCC overcome these impact constraining difficulties.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis</subject><subject source="local">Microfinance.</subject><subject source="local">Poverty Alleviation</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7c177a21d94f0643e03699e744cfead5" level="item"><did><unittitle>The humanitarian space in peril -  how do recent political developments affect the work of international relief NGOs</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00062</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Henghuber, Heinz</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9b950c1e9a9eca917422aaa641d53178"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_f9c185606814c8063baf408a3d1df461"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  The 'humanitarian space' of relief NGOs is more than ever endangered. Many political developments, such as belligerent military doing aid work, deliberate targeting of aid workers or politicisation of aid, are not new, but accelerating, aggravating trends. They are challenging how international relief NGOs work today and how they will work in the future. Humanitarian aid agencies are forced to adjust and position to the increasing complexity of this environment.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">International Organizations</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian aid</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian Space</subject><subject source="local">Relief</subject><subject source="local">NGO</subject><subject source="local">Neutrality</subject><subject source="local">Impartiality</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian Principles</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d65fbc004291d9346c1ae8570fdfc443" level="item"><did><unittitle>Carbon finance and solar water heating technology: exploring possible synergies through five case studies</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00063</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Milton, Samuel P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7b5f29702733b478c17978e9973e1fdb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e786ef5625d5424b1655353253822b14"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper explores the potential of carbon finance to boost markets for solar water heating (SWH) technology in developing countries.  The promise of greater adoption of SWH systems into a global energy paradigm is important for sustainable development efforts, since SWH systems can yield multiple local and global environmental, economic, and public health benefits.  Carbon finance, in particular, is an important vehicle for sustainable development due to its ability to harness market forces for the greater good.  In this paper, after a brief introduction of the issues, the second section offers an outline of the political, economic and environmental context in which carbon finance has evolved to become an important tool for the global effort to reduce emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  This paper then examines specific carbon trading mechanisms that have developed over years of negotiation and trial and error, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF), and it provides an overview of the myriad components of these mechanisms that are especially critical for their meaningful contribution to sustainable development.  It concludes the third section with a summary of the current market for carbon-based commodities.  The fourth section offers a survey of SWH technology and describes some of the technology's attributes that make it a suitable component of sustainable development efforts.  This section also introduces many of the barriers that have traditionally prevented SWH from gaining a foothold in the residential and commercial energy sectors.  The fifth section then explores how the CDM and CDCF could affect SWH markets.  It does this first through a specific examination of these mechanisms' operational modalities and then attempts to find possible linkages where SWH markets can take advantage of carbon markets.  Through the lens of five case studies of countries that have active SWH markets  Barbados, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa  the sixth section assesses the state of the SWH market in those countries and seeks to find more precise possible synergistic relationships between those markets and carbon finance.  It explores many aspects of the these countries' demand for hot water, prevailing market conditions for conventional fuels and SWH technology, barriers to greater SWH adoption, and current initiatives to strengthen the position of SWH in the domestic marketplace.  This section concludes by offering some insight into the potential for carbon finance to influence SWH markets.  Finally, the last section offers some closing remarks and considerations for future activities to stimulate further synergies between carbon finance and SWH markets.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Environment and Resource Policy</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Renewable Energy</subject><subject source="local">Solar</subject><subject source="local">Solar Water Heating</subject><subject source="local">Carbon</subject><subject source="local">Carbon Markets</subject><subject source="local">Carbon Trading</subject><subject source="local">CDM</subject><subject source="local">Kyoto Protocol</subject><subject source="local">CDCF</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject><subject source="local">Global Warming</subject><subject source="local">Climate Change</subject><subject source="local">UNFCCC</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Energy</subject><subject source="local">Energy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1877b415fc5a3385aae3fb564a8c866c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Private securities litigations against foreign firms: empirical findings</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00064</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Alanko, Reeta</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7156431768527700d1c63518df3744b8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b5cd92ae426cb35ef4cb05db722916ea"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: As foreign firms all over the world are increasingly cross-listing on U.S. stock exchanges, there is a vigorous discussion going on among academics as to why foreign firms cross-list on a U.S. stock exchange.  One of the most discussed reasons is the 'bonding hypothesis' according to which foreign firms cross-list on US stock exchanges in order to leapfrog their home countries' weak legal institutions by agreeing to abide by U.S. securities regulations. The bonding hypothesis is criticized by several academics for two reasons. First, foreign firms are bound to a different, and arguably to a less stringent securities regulation regime. Second, the Securities Exchange Commission is criticized for insufficient enforcement of its rules on foreign issuers. However, most of these studies have disregarded private securities litigation as a way to enforce bonding with the U.S. regulatory regime. This paper is an exploratory study that presents an overview of the academic discussion relating to the bonding hypothesis and to constructively reflect on the critique against it.  I find that large accounting scandals during recent years have induced the Congress to enact more severe corporate governance regulations for both foreign and domestic firms. Foreign firms are increasingly treated equally with domestic firms. Nevertheless, the standards remain lower for foreign firms today. Even though the extraterritorial reach of U.S. securities filing requirements is limited, the U.S. courts have been able to establish a broader extraterritoriality for the U.S. securities fraud provision. Thus foreign firms with a lower level of commitment to the U.S. markets (level I ADR) are held liable under the U.S. securities fraud provisions. Consequently, the threat of securities litigation under securities fraud provisions bond the foreign firms to the U.S. corporate governance regime and to the same insider trading rules than the U.S. based firms are bound to. Thus, private securities litigation has an opportunity to serve as a mechanism to enforce bonding with the U.S. securities regulation. The descriptive analysis confirms the findings of literature review and reveals that foreign firms are increasingly interested in cross-listing on the NYSE and voluntarily bonding to the most stringent securities regulations. Most of the new cross-listing on the NYSE are from civil law countries and from emerging markets. This finding is consistent with the prior research on the bonding hypothesis that firms from lower corporate governance regime are motivated the most by the bonding reasons to cross-list. The data reveal that the private securities cases enforce foreign firms to bond to the U.S. securities regime. Foreign firms are treated uniformly with domestic firms, and the likeliness to get sued is equivalent for both foreign and domestic firms.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Business and Economic Law</subject><subject source="local">International Business Relations</subject><subject source="local">Bonding Hypothesis</subject><subject source="local">Securities Litigations</subject><subject source="local">Cross-listing</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_29168d6e4b7e72742f4207d10cda35de" level="item"><did><unittitle>The U.S. Orange Juice Tariff and the 'Brazilian Invasion' of Florida</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00065</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hart, Ezequiel O.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_751ec0bf345499686122829187e46209"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_43a7e27fc57210937677af09057881fc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The Florida citrus industry has always been buffered from overseas competition by a U.S. tariff on orange juice. During the 1990s four Brazil-based orange juice processors (BBPs), including the two dominant orange juice exporters in the world, purchased plants in Florida. By the beginning of the current decade the four companies controlled nearly half the processing capacity in the state. The orange juice tariff is currently threatened by negotiations over the FTAA (which is scheduled to enter into force by January 2005), as well as in the WTO. As a prominent participant in these negotiations, Brazil is demanding U.S. concessions in agriculture, including specifically the orange juice tariff. While the industry has defeated attempts to reduce or eliminate the tariff in the past, never before have foreign companies, which would benefit from a removal of the tariff, been significant actors within the industry. This paper investigates the role that the BBPs are playing and could still play in the debate over the orange juice tariff. The first analytical section of the paper investigates the motivations for the BBPs' FDI in Florida. The paper then analyzes the industry's competitive landscape, and finds that the BBPs have accelerated the downstream consolidation of the value chain. Next, the possible effects of tariff elimination are discussedwith a conclusion that the industry would be hurt, but not destroyed. The final section tests the hypothesis that the entry of the BBPs into Florida has increased the likelihood of a U.S. concession on the tariff. It concludes that the BBPs have not inserted themselves into the political mix for several reasons, including ambivalence (due to vested interests), a fear of anti-foreigner sentiment, and a scarcity of nonmarket strategic resources. In the conclusion, the paper speculates on the future of the tariff debate and discusses broader implications emanating from this case.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Trade and Commerce Policies</subject><subject source="local">International Policaty Economy</subject><subject source="local">Tariff</subject><subject source="local">Orange Juice</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject><subject source="local">FDI</subject><subject source="local">Interest Group</subject><subject source="local">FTAA</subject><subject source="local">Free Trade Area of the Americas</subject><subject source="local">Alca</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject><corpname source="local">World Trade Organization</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9b8191768cfbb4f776c36ded7b100ca0" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Physical Security of Refugees in Kenyan Camps: Legal and Human Rights Implications</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00066</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Halperin, Liv H.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5e6542769137ccfe0cce38558f616cd7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_2c06fb127ec5c9daedaaa385f80fa1f3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: The pace of economic and trade liberalization has increased dramatically in recent years.  Advocates of increased liberalization point to the long-term economic benefits that global open markets encourage:  increased efficiency, greater variety in consumption, increased income.  Critics of further trade liberalization often cite the severe, economic hardship that often afflicts the poorest sectors during the transition period, and the limitations international trade agreements can place on national sovereignty over domestic public policy decisions.  The two camps are often pitted against each other with little effective dialogue occurring.  This paper will examine the effectiveness of and strategies used by United States' NGOs in influencing the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. The hypothesis that US-based NGOs exhibit a 'boomerang effect' in their strategies is examined.  It is suggested that the anti-FTAA positions do not resonate with the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and that therefore these organizations have found greater impact on the FTAA draft text and negotiations by partnering with Southern NGOs to influence Southern governments.  The paper concludes with recommendations on improving the effectiveness of NGOs that are critical of the FTAA.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Political Economy</subject><subject source="local">Trade</subject><subject source="local">FTAA</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Liberalization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c40ff303ccad3a176f057fcf370321dd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Justice, Peace and Reconciliation in Post-Conflict Societies: the Case of Sierra Leone</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00068</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rodella, Aude-Sophie</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_216a888475179a1d34fab2ab8e822584"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5541bcf89f1578a06a66007d7e35c353"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The subject of this thesis between law, philosophy and political science could easily fall into the trap of a scholar discussion of the given subject, away from the daunting realities of the people those subjects are dealing with. Justice and Policy-making in post-conflict societies have a face, the one of the victims, perpetrators, 'most responsible ones' and bystanders. One should not forget the crucial human dimension of those issues, as war crimes are born in flesh, heart and mind. This paper aims at reviewing the literature existing on the subjects of peace, justice and reconciliation and their links in the post-conflict agenda and reality. Indeed, it appears that post-conflict has become a field in itself, resulting in the three notions being conceived as concomitant, though very little evidence of the well-founded of this approach has been proven yet. This analysis will attempt to demonstrate that the recurrent association over the past year of those three notions of peace, justice and reconciliation, in the post-conflict locus and agenda, has resulted in its auto-validating use, and the progressive erosion of the necessary prudence its largely axiomatic nature requires. The chosen angle to approach the subject will evaluate post-conflict theory and experiences around the challenge and goal of justice faced by countries emerging from protracted conflicts such as Sierra Leone. Indeed, while justice has long been the victors' prerogative, tainting the very enterprise with selective bias, one has seen with the end of the Cold War the appearance of a new pragmatic paradigm. This new paradigm intends to connect post-conflict justice's implementation with the concomitant challenges of fostering peace and reconciliation. Such a paradigm results from a syncretic association of many trends born out of the identification of justice as the force capable of legitimizing a given peace agreement (not necessarily enforced on the ground) and stabilizing in the meantime, and beyond, the post-conflict transition. From this perspective, the locus of justice is used to frame a comprehensive approach encompassing both peace and reconciliation in post-conflict settings.  Moreover, the authoritative use of the legal discourse offers a legitimization of this concomitant approach. Yet, if the limited corpus of endorsed positive experiences should have undermined the high expectations associated with post-conflict justice, the latter seems to have benefited paradoxically from the legal experiments led in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. In fact, more than concrete (or rather lack of) successes on the ground, it appears that the repetitive use of the theoretical dimension of this enlarged justice approach has led to its self-validation among the post-conflict agenda's actors. Incidentally, it seems that as for the challenges/ goals of peace and reconciliation, the definition of what should be understood by post-conflict justice remains evasive, in spite of the large consequences it has in the post-conflict agenda's determination, and the very commitment of International Community (IC). As such, I have taken the party to approach the subject of post-conflict justice in exploring the conventional/agreed association of justice and peace (I.) as well as of justice and reconciliation (II.) in order to assess the ground, both scholarly and in reality, that founds the conception of justice currently displayed in on-going post-conflict cases. This analysis will try to highlight the limits of the present definition of post-conflict justice and the lack of realism and clarity of its objectives, through the perspective of past experiences as well as in the light of post-conflict Sierra Leone. Indeed, due to its tragic history over the last ten years, Sierra Leone finds itself at the confluence of these recent evolutions in the 'fields' of post-conflict justice, peace and reconciliation. Sierra Leone (III.) is indeed in the unprecedented situation of having made the choice of an internationalized Court given with the mandate of judging the 'most responsible ones', the Special Court for Sierra Leone (part A.), as well as of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (part B.).  Moreover, as a result of the scope of the crimes committed during the ten-year conflict, as well as due to the role played by amnesty in the peace settlement, an important part of the legacy is being left to the respective communities, emphasizing the importance of local processes of dispute resolution and reconciliation (part C.). While an attempt to design a post-conflict agenda that would address the challenge of justice and reconciliation in a coherent, complementary and reinforcing mode has been envisioned, little of this idea has been yet implemented in Sierra Leone. Therefore, Sierra Leone will provide a crucial and much needed reality test to the post-conflict justice-peace-reconciliation approach, through the establishment of both the TRC and the SCSL, and their respective jurisprudence. Additionally, this experience is taking place at the time of the take off of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and could also impact the development of this instance. Indeed, the United States are adamant promoters of Sierra Leone mixed-tribunal, as a counter-strategy against the ICC. Ironically, Sierra Leone finds itself caught up between those divergent dynamics, having signed a bilateral impunity agreement with the United States while being part of the ICC. However, it is important to keep in mind that the 'experiment' dimension of Sierra Leone with regard to the post-conflict agenda should not ultimately prove detrimental to those the populations it is supposed to serve.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis</subject><subject source="local">Public International Law</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0b17a0e41319f50f1379a82588f5bdac" level="item"><did><unittitle>Emergence of New Political Identity in the South Caucasus: Energy, Security, Strategic Location and Pragmatism</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00069</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Suleymanov, Elin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_673d0a6148c18b31e26d6445825c0e9d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b29505c514fecbf9b3d6bd7eda9eb7ce"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The South Caucasus is a boiling pot of various faiths, ethnicities, historical memories and political orientations, has traditionally been subject to strong, often overwhelming external pressures.  The example of strong regional partnership between Azerbaijan and Georgia, two nations with very different dominant ethnic and religious groups, shows that not only a cooperative arrangement within the South Caucasus is possible, but also that it is, clearly, in the interest of its participants. Following the wave of strong nationalism, Azerbaijan and Georgia, unlike Armenia have opted for more pragmatic politics. Pragmatism became a trademark policy for Baku and Tbilisi establishing foundation of strong bilateral partnership.  The Azerbaijan-Georgia partnership forced the world to look at the Caucasus in a new, different way.  Much of this new pragmatism has been built on the ability to balance various pressures in a dynamic regional equilibrium. This includes careful consideration of perceptions of national security in the region, which are focused on potential negative influences of Russia and Iran; the unresolved state of the Armenia-Azerbaijan and other regional conflicts; and the challenge of strengthening state institutions.  At the same time, Caspian energy projects play a key role in bringing about positive changes in the South Caucasus and promoting cooperative model of regional integration.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis</subject><subject source="local">International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</subject><subject source="local">Oil</subject><subject source="local">Security</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_07a98ec78bae3c6741498c61d0928576" level="item"><did><unittitle>The 'National Interest' Tradition and the Foreign Policy of Albania</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00070</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shembilku, Rozeta E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_19b0e90b7281502194cdf103aeda5d8d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_83febe329312f370fad6062f6b1455f9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  With the demise of communism, Albanian foreign policy was punctuated by an era of fundamental change qualitatively separated from the past.  That era is being marked by Albania's efforts to build a democratic society that, if successful, would enable Albania gradually to prosper and enjoy closer ties with neighbours and the Western world as well as with their political, economic and security organisations.  Today there is a widespread agreement that Albania's political philosophy and institutional environment are changing significantly along with moral principles and interests with which it feels identified.  This turning point in the nation's history has resulted in growing pressure on Albanian leaders to 'reinvent' the foreign policy of Albania.  Calls have been issued for the formulation of new strategies and policies that would create conditions that promote Albania's stability, security and prosperity, and would prepare the nation to deal with realities of nationalisms in Southeastern Europe as well as the prospects of regional co-operation and European integration.  Clearly, Albanian leaders will need some guidelines for the formulation and analysis of foreign policy as well as for deciding in a systematic fashion, what activities to oppose and where to let events run their course.  Traditionally, at least in the Western world, the concept of national interest has served as this standard.  A commonly accepted definition of 'national interest' -- at least in the Western world -- refers to it as 'the general and continuing ends for which a nation acts.'  However, if the concept of national interest is to be of greater utility, it must be more precisely defined so as to provide a greater measure of policy guidance to decision-makers.  For several reasons, defining the new Albania's national interests is particularly difficult.  First, this process necessarily takes place in the domestic context, and reflects the character of the internal political system and the relative fortunes of political leaders, parties, factions, and schools of thought.  The severe political instability that prevails in Albania produces substantial uncertainty about how it will come to define and defend its national interests.  Second, by virtue of its geo-political position and location and the identity of its neighbours, Albania must confront security threats, inescapable diplomatic relationships, worrying scenarios, and neighbouring trouble spots.  Establishing priorities among these issues will, at times, be difficult.  Third, Albania, as a former-communist society with a legacy of chronic isolation, absent socio-economic modernisation and a daunting democratic deficit, could not immediately put in place a coherent and widely accepted conception of its national interests and requirements -- it could not even conduct a well developed national debate.  In view of these considerations, it is not surprising that Albania has yet to determine its identity, its national interests, or its place in the world.  In other words, Albania faces the task of developing its national purpose as a political ideology and of articulating a vision of the national interest, which refers to something of substance and weight in the life of nations.  That is the aim of this work, to provide an account of the concept of the national interest and to examine the choices that confront Albania as it seeks to define its national interests.  The argument here is that, if Albanian foreign policy needs to mature and emerge successful from the trials of the new era, it should follow 'one guiding star, one standard for thought, one rule for action: the national interest.'</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Political Systems and Theories</subject><subject source="local">Foreign Policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a0f8f3d8791727d61da5aa43bce12fe2" level="item"><did><unittitle>High-Tech Innovation in Emerging Markets: The Case of Mexico</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00071</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Barber, Tamara</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a81d497cb13d82943b4d4d84453d55ff"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a7f189bcf86f5878a3e29542bcb7f764"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper presents an exploratory study of innovation systems supporting the electronics and IT industry in Guadalajara, Mexico. Specifically, this study focuses on the effects of linkages with Regional Innovation Systems (RIS) and Supernational Innovation Systems (SIS) at the firm level. Analysis of data gathered in a 2004 survey of 39 companies in Guadalajara suggest that the RIS is more effective than the SIS in building and maintaining innovative capacity through R&amp;D departments and overall R&amp;D activity. The findings imply that, in the case of Mexico, the most effective policies to promote innovation will focus on regional linkages and capacity-building, rather than looking to firms with supernational linkages as a main source of capacity building and spillovers.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Information technology</subject><subject source="local">Intellectual Property</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject><subject source="local">Technology and State</subject><subject source="local">Technology transfer</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_95da231ce80b0680abef81db7fa9da6c" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Global/Local Approach to Conflict Resolution in the Mining Sector: The Case of the Tintaya Dialogue Table</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00072</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Barton, Brooke Dawn</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_99d197ec6d12a10c32eedef86a5854aa"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_8dd4fc7f472d3d8c743c1e9577c4ad11"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Mining-related conflict has become a permanent feature of the political landscape in many developing countries, where encounters between mining companies and local communities are increasingly characterized by public protest, violent conflict and the notable absence of state intervention. Despite this trend, little research has been done to understand the factors that promote successful conflict resolution between mining companies and host communities. This paper investigates an innovative approach to corporate-community conflict resolution that uses transnational advocacy coalitions to support mining-affected communities at both the micro and macro levels. It analyzes the effectiveness of this global/local strategy in the context of recent stakeholder negotiations at Peru's Tintaya copper mine, and asks whether transnational advocacy coalitions can bring about the kind of participatory engagement that promotes rights-based development. The analysis finds that these coalitions, by pressuring companies in their home countries and empowering local communities through grassroots organizing and training, can effectively facilitate negotiations that build trust between the parties, reduce power asymmetries and lead to lasting agreements.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Environmental Policy</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject><subject source="local">Natural resources</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations</subject><subject source="local">Pollution</subject><subject source="local">Poverty</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b1cbaad85738b097608c0a3cb185ac4e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Modeling and Employing the Human Security Approach:  A Health Security Perspective on the Current International Response to the HIV Epidemic</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00073</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bhadelia, Nahid</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f4b5e4a26dc0156f45ee5a3bc099690a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_225e667c8bb57c49b0ef80e2bc7ea94a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Like all neologisms, human security carries a lot of hope. Particularly in the sector of health, human security has introduced a new urgency, a greater political will and a sense of connectivity between the houses of 'haves' and 'have-nots'. The impact of global infectious diseases, violence and diseases related to poverty threaten the gains of development in low and middle income countries. What should a human security approach to health issues, particularly HIV, entail? Drawing on work by Sabina Alkire (2002), this paper asserts that human security interventions should be based on three principles: the focus on the individual as the nexus of analysis, the use of equity as the process, and the pursuit of institutionalized, responsive and preventive solutions. The importance and utility of these codes are elucidated by means of application to the concept of 'health security'. It is argued that a greater emphasis on social determinants of health, a higher rate of civil registration to ensure inclusion of vulnerable groups and a primary care approach to health delivery embody the spirit of health security. The validity of these arguments is tested by relating their relevance to the current international response to the HIV epidemic. This paper then concludes with some policy recommendations and emphasizes the central role of good governance in all human security programming.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">AIDS (Disease)</subject><subject source="local">Community development</subject><subject source="local">International agencies</subject><subject source="lcsh">Medical care</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">Social Policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_076a764ed85c7c784f9b2b304f2b5987" level="item"><did><unittitle>Constitution-Making and Immutable Principles</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00074</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brooke, Sam</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b7efeac58722d897d6aff27d396e2475"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9d7c34eb549961db6980892c97dc4803"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The concept of immutable principles broadly defined as unchangeable, substantive principles which provide a check on a political process has impacted constitutions in two manners. First, the difficulties of developing new constitutions in post-conflict situations has occasionally been alleviated by the usage of immutable principles, the clearest example of this being South Africa's Constitution of 1996. Second, immutable principles have been used to limit the amendability of certain constitutions, making certain rights or principles permanently entrenched. This has been seen in Germany and India. The purpose of this thesis is to compare and contrast the historical usage of immutable principles in these two different settings (i.e., limits on the formulation of new constitutions versus limits on existing constitutions), and to outline considerations for their continued use.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Comparative government</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Law reform</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5ff4092266f7dacbe820cf481c2e12b8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Decentralization and Human Security in Kosovo: Prospects of Local Government Reform for Promoting Democracy, Development, and Conflict Mitigation</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00075</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Burke, Shannon</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7e3355a68b47b2ae8540d6185fc85ac5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7cdffe2e6405cd3e7623529c07c7e995"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Five years after war ravaged the former Yugoslav territory of Kosova/Kosovo,  decentralization has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing key challenges to democracy, development, and sustainable peace in the troubled province. The principle of decentralization enjoys widespread support from both of Kosovo's major ethnic groups the Albanians and the Serbs as well as the international community that has been administering the province since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervened to halt Serb ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population in 1999. However, each of these groups has distinct ideas concerning the purpose of decentralization and how the process should be carried out. This paper will examine the current decentralization debate in Kosovo and analyze the extent to which the proposals put forth by the Council of Europe (CoE), the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) and the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), and the Serbian government would would promote human security in the province. This paper begins with an overview of Kosovo's present demographic composition. Chapter 2 outlines the major demographic trends affecting the province during the war and the post-conflict period and discusses how these trends have influenced the current decentralization debate. It also provides background on the evolution of local government in Kosovo over the past five years through outlining key UNMIK Regulations and their implications for local governing institutions. Lastly, it examines the origins of the major decentralization proposals currently under consideration. Local government reform has the potential to bolster human security through improving democratic representation in Kosovo. A well-designed decentralization strategy could achieve this goal through bringing institutions of local government closer to the people and increasing their authority and accountability. Chapter 3 begins with a discussion of the current status of democracy in Kosovo. It traces the progress that has been made over the past five years towards the important goal of laying a foundation for sustainable democracy in the province. It then describes the decentralization strategies proposed in the CoE recommendations, the Prishtina/Pristina Plan endorsed by UNMIK and the PISG, and the Belgrade Plan devised by the Serbian government. It considers the critical issues of how many local government units would be created according to each of these decentralization strategies, how the boundaries of these units would be determined, and how these units would be governed. It also analyzes the implications of each decentralization plan for enhancing democratic representation throughout Kosovo. In addition to promoting representative democracy, decentralization can bolster human security in Kosovo through improving its level of development and the quality of its public services. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the standard of living in contemporary Kosovo, using information gleaned from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Kosovo Human Development Report 2004. Kosovans have the lowest level of development in the Balkans, as measured by the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI). Poverty and unemployment are pervasive, particularly in rural areas. Moreover, many Kosovans lack access to such basic services as education, health care, and water and sanitation. This situation is exacerbated by confused lines of accountability that make it difficult for Kosovans to determine who is responsible for providing which services. Nevertheless, the population remains confident that local government reform would improve public services and foster development in the province. The chapter then evaluates the CoE, UNMIK/PISG, and Serbian government decentralization plans in terms of their prospects for advancing development in Kosovo. It describes which responsibilities would be devolved to local governing units under each plan, and how these proposed arrangements would affect the quality of services and level of development in the province. In addition to affecting democratic representation, service provision, and development levels, decentralization has the potential to strengthen human security through supporting peace and stability in Kosovo. Local government reform is closely linked to the sensitive ethnic issues at the core of the Kosovo conflict. The plans proposed by the CoE, UNMIK/PISG, and Serbian government would have radically different implications for Kosovo's ethnic composition. Depending on which plan is selected and how the chosen plan is implemented, decentralization could mitigate ethnic tensions and foster stability in Kosovo by giving minority communities greater autonomy and more channels to promote their interests without resorting to violence. However, decentralization also risks hardening existing ethnic divisions and undermining stability, both within Kosovo and throughout the Balkan region. Chapter 5 evaluates the decentralization strategies proposed by the CoE, UNMIK/PISG, and the Serbian government in terms of their potential to alleviate the ethnic tensions in Kosovo. It recognizes that local government reform will only succeed in the province if it obtains support from minority communities in general, and the influential Serb community in particular. To this end, it analyzes the extent to which each of the aforementioned proposals would safeguard minority rights and provide minority groups with channels to advance their interests, as well as how acceptable each proposal would be to minority communities; especially the Serbs. It also considers the possible impact of decentralization in Kosovo on the delicate ethnic balance in Serbia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The paper concludes by discussing recent developments in the decentralization debate, including approval of a pilot municipality proposal. It evaluates the implications of this proposal and suggests strategies to ensure that the final decentralization plan for Kosovo meets European Charter standards and can be sold to both the Albanian opposition and the Serb community.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Community development</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Law reform</subject><subject source="local">Minorities</subject><subject source="local">Peace</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0ef70809dadca58c3d888c6a4e39d0ba" level="item"><did><unittitle>Japanese Constitutional Reform and Maritime Security in East Asia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00076</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Byington, John K.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4bf1e56b7d083e8c936359bf34f720d7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_70b304c5fc72d6cfe097157b46419a66"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Maritime security is becoming one of the top areas of concern for states in East Asia. Japan, with its large and technologically advanced navy, is in a unique position to shape the regional maritime security order. Currently, legal restraints placed on the use of force under the country's pacifist constitution limit Japan's ability to project its influence. Proposed changes to the constitution, however, may alter the situation dramatically. This paper examines the likely effects of constitutional reforms on Japan's future role in East Asian maritime security.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_49709a070aaa42234e21b8ed50c054d3" level="item"><did><unittitle>U.S. Missile Defense: Implications for Sino-U.S. Arms Race</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00077</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Choi, Hyun-Jin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_74d26d2f478e46c4e82c4bc861659501"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_79761bd5eeaf61d2eb16b90c860ee1f8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: In December 2002, President George W. Bush officially announced his plan to begin deployment of initial missile defense capabilities in 2004-2005. The deployment of missile defense is an essential element of the United States' broader efforts to meet its new strategic challenges in the twenty first century. Once deployed, missile defense can secure the U.S. force projection capability while providing an additional safety net against growing threats from WMDs in the hands of hostile regimes and international terrorists. But, Chinese government has strongly criticized the U.S. missile defense plan. Beijing warned that U.S. missile defense could not only undermine strategic stability, but also lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles. A primary reason for Chinese criticism against missile defense is that even a limited system would undercut China's own nuclear deterrent vis-a-vis the United States. Currently, China has only about twenty liquid-fuel silo-based ICBMs that can reach the U.S. If U.S. would initiate a first strike, the Chinese assume that only a handful of Chinese ICBMs would survive. And the handful that would survive the first strike would be captured by missile defense systems. Many in China believe that such disadvantage would pose a serious menace to China's ability to employ its nuclear weapons to deter possible U.S. pressure and aggression in East Asia. Then, what would Sino-U.S. strategic relations look like under the fully-deployed missile defense, as well as how would it be affected by actual missile defense architectures employed? The thesis takes up this question and argues that prospects for Sino-U.S. arms race depend on the different types of missile defense architecture: limited, limited layered, and robust. And whether China enters into an arms race with the U.S. or not under the respective type of architecture is constrained by five variables: grand strategy in Chinese history; nuclear doctrine; military technology; economic resources; and China's commitment to arms control regimes.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_dbab0f36f2e3f168a4c94d8d6bf4a50e" level="item"><did><unittitle>State Responsibility for Global Climate Change: The Case of the Maldives</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00078</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Davis, Joy-Dee Samantha</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b3bba67bd1cc27ba1b02332b748f11ff"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a513362cceeee6681bebc346735e33c2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

It will firstly seek to establish state responsibility within the context of international human rights law. By this, it will implicitly determine if there exists a justiceable human right to the environment. Secondly, it will examine the general sources of international law in an effort to determine state responsibility.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Environmental Policy</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_765d9fd020cf48118b23fad41706b802" level="item"><did><unittitle>Imagined Nations:  Toward a Functional Approach to the Future of International Relations</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00079</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Delaune, Timothy A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_287aeb39e331b41315daf4df7f760820"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4f662fab1a9f270306aae244a75503fc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Beginning with a review of definitions employed in scholarship on nationalism, including Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities, this thesis moves directly to an examination of the loosening ties between political geography -- understood as the superimposition on the globe of territorial boundaries marking the extent of state sovereignty -- and the functions and characteristics ordinarily associated with nationhood, in an effort to demonstrate that the requirement of international law that sovereignty and statehood follow control of territory only is increasingly out of step with the needs and verities of world politics and society. It then surveys some theories of networked nations and other nonstate communities, as well as historical and current examples of nonterritorial networks that in various ways present features similar to those commonly understood to be possessed by nations. It attempts to derive from these examples a functional approach to nationhood that is, an approach that defines nationhood not with respect to what a candidate nation is but rather according to what it does. Having advanced this functional approach to nationhood, the thesis then describes some candidate imagined nations, and examines two prison nation and queer nation more closely, in an attempt to evaluate the functional model's ability to track more closely than the legal definition of statehood candidate nations international roles and significance. It concludes with some tentative predictions about the future of the international system understood as one in which states are not the only, or even the primary actors, as well as some prescriptions for future research on the international personality of nonstate networks.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Ethnic relations</subject><subject source="local">Globalization</subject><subject source="local">History</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject><subject source="local">Transnational crime</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a85a6c8d74731821797e3da2ccbb7f55" level="item"><did><unittitle>Capitalizing on Women's Traditional Roles in Israeli Peace Activism: A Comparison Between Women in Black and Checkpoint Watch</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00080</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Deutsch-Nadir, Sharon</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_562b6fd2727d87b20920704d100fcd0e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_12c850b1efd35fdf8b3307c6e67f2e98"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Women's peace activism in conflict areas lies at the intersection of traditional and non-traditional. On the one hand, a growing body of literature and research refers to women, when compared to men, as more peace loving. On the other hand, peace activism, or any kind of activism for that matter, is practiced in the public sphere, and challenges defining societal and political roles of women. As women in the 21st century, following feminist activism, are continuously encouraged, to go outside the home and against their traditional social place, the question remains: What if women's unique skills are the significant asset they offer to conflict management and conflict resolution? Does capitalizing on women's unique skills as peace activists creates the necessary culture of peace on the way to the resolution of a conflict? In this paper I have chosen to examine these questions through the work of women peace activists in Israel. The research is divided into four main parts. The first section provides the theoretical framework for women's peace activism in conflict areas; The second part focuses on women's peace activism in Israel, elaborating on the social context of women's activism in Israel; the third part covers the case studies I have chosen to compare Women in Black (in Hebrew Nashim beshachor) and Machsom Watch (in English: Checkpoint Watch), which represent two different strategies for their involvement in peace activism; and finally the conclusions section refers to the initial question of this work, particularly regarding the context of Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not my objective to discuss the contribution of women's peace activism to the status of women in the societies they work within, or specifically in Israel, since the link between feminism and peace activism is not a consistant one. It is my intention, however, to highlight the strength, cooperation and legitimacy emanating from women's peace work in Israel where non-traditional activism is complemented by women's perceived traditional roles in Israeli social narrative.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Peace</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cf6becc6dacd3bab8ade36dd76abf554" level="item"><did><unittitle>Chinese National Unity vs. Uyghur Separatism: Can Information and Communication Technologies Integrated with a Customized Economic Development Plan Help Avoid a Cultural Collision?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00081</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Eranosian, Nancy</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ed7f6ba19d64c32bda4297e40964b641"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_259e47d3379eebae4abb913631ce60e1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Current tension in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region created by the Chinese desire for greater national unity and the Uyghur desire for independence is leading the two cultures to a potential collision. The Chinese government is practicing five policies to reduce the Uyghur threat: the politicization of Islam, migration of Han Chinese into the region, and the use of language, education and media to accelerate assimilation of the Uyghurs into the dominant Han culture. This paper analyzes the five policies from a communications perspective and proposes a telecenter ICT solution combined with a customized economic development program to help mitigate the Uyghurs' desire for independence.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Communication</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Information technology</subject><subject source="local">Minorities</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">Social Policy</subject><subject source="local">Technology and State</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_237c1afbb5b016345984bc16b30ff05f" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Fair Trade Response to the Coffee Crisis.

Abstract: The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989 has been followed by a dramatic drop in world coffee crisis and and by a perception of a large-scale social crisis among rural populations in developing countries. The Fair Trade movement which has arisen out of Alternative Trade Organizations based in industrial countries is an attempt to redress income differences between industrialized and developing countries through trade that benefits poor farmers to uplift them from poverty. This study examines the effectiveness of the Fair Trade system in the case of coffee at achieving its own goals which include both absolute poverty reduction as well as social justice understood as redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor. Since Fair Trade is designed as a response to the current system of global trading relationships and the characteristics of the coffee market in particular, global trends in the coffee sector are being examined that point to paradigm shifts in both coffee demand and supply, the development of a differentiated coffee market and restructuring of the coffee supply chain. These processes have negative impacts on small-scale coffee growers in many producing countries but also offer opportunities to escape the downward spiral of coffee prices. Fair Trade represents one of them. The development mechanism of the Fair Trade system will be illustrated in a cost-benefit analysis of a participating producer cooperative in Mexico. The analysis shows that the size of increases in income for individual farmers varies according to a number of factors but can be substantial. On the other hand, it is often over-looked that obtaining and maintaining certification is expensive, and even more so if producers are also certified as 'organic', while organic certification also implies an even higher price premium. Apart from increases in income Fair Trade brings along a variety of other benefits, both individual, in the form of price stability and enhanced access to credit and training, and collective ones. The latter include environmental goods, development projects, investment in infrastructure to upgrade the cooperative's activities and organizational strengthening through better access to market information. To determine the Fair Trade system's ability to redistribute profits between actors in consuming and producing countries, gains from participation for the various operators in the coffee supply chain are examined. The results seem to indicate that apart from coffee cooperatives, all other agents, including roasters and retailers, obtain substantial price premia from Fair Trade coffee sales and that the system's successes in reducing the profits of large industry players are therefore limited. Fair Trade organizations and firms are market participants that try to challenge conventional profit-oriented companies by outcompeting them and by creating sustainable businesses. The aim of this endeavour is to ultimately induce a change to mainstream business practices in favor of producers also outside of the Fair Trade system itself, ideally with major companies behaving in an ATO like manner and guaranteeing decent trade conditions and prices to farmers. A third criterion against which Fair Trade is being evaluated is therefore the extent to which Fair Trade has had an impact on conventional business practices and in extension on the well-being of poor producers more broadly. A survey of other initiatives in the coffee market aiming at sustainability and its comparison to the Fair Trade system shows that industry changes are underway, but that the standards that are evolving are likely to show little resemblence with the Fair Trade standards. Again, the movement's success is a partial one. Finally, the growth perspectives for Fair Trade coffee both in the mainstream and in the niche market are being examined.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject><subject source="local">Community development</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Environmental Policy</subject><subject source="local">Globalization</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_901a24fcb42de4608fbf6738b8526728" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Memorable Process in a Forgotten War: Forgiveness Within Northern Uganda</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00083</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Finnegan, Amy Colleen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_301262cb24fe33908fed0d69638b850b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_222df3206981bcf1c2f31d9ac4f073c6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Northern Uganda has experienced a devastating war for the past eighteen years, forgotten to the rest of the world. Within this war-torn society of Acholiland, a sub-region of Northern Uganda, the author highlights how processes of forgiveness have occurred and are ongoing, arguing that they have a significant impact on the process of conflict resolution. In addition to providing evidence of forgiveness through her personal observations and interviews, research she conducted with the Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative (ARLPI) and extensive secondary source material, the author outlines the theories of forgiveness and the historical context of Northern Uganda.   In the central part of the thesis, the author lays out possible reasons behind why forgiveness is playing a role including the influence of religion in Acholiland, the failure of other methods of conflict resolution, cultural explanations, and a sense of family prevalent between the Acholi and many of the abducted members of the Lord's Resistance Army, the insurgency group. The author then provides a solid analysis of the impact of forgiveness as well as lessons learned from the Northern Uganda case of forgiveness.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Intervention (International law)</subject><subject source="local">Negotiation</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations</subject><subject source="local">Peace</subject><subject source="local">Reconciliation</subject><subject source="local">War</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4f4278940d3a0bd58d1378173b35cb57" level="item"><did><unittitle>Global Research and Development Investment Practices; does General Electric differ from the trend?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00084</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Holmberg, William  WCH</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_72aba14a37b1d3f253a766536c564380"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ad316d4008a6043a685c921f7c00a23a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This survey-based comparative study examines the trends observed in an empirical study of 32 multinational firms' research and development (R&amp;D) investment practices and compares and contrasts the data and results to that of the General Electric Corporation (GE). The quantitative comparison between the two studies demonstrates that GE R&amp;D investment practices were consistent with 4 of the primary 5 trends observed in the initial empirical study. Consistencies were found in the practices of motives, locational characteristics, the relationship between R&amp;D facilities in home country versus abroad and mode of entry, and were not found in evolution of FDI in R&amp;D centers over time. The adoption of these practices might present practitioners and academics a set of best practices in investment-related considerations when defining a development plan for international expansion of its R&amp;D practice. Key words: globalization of research and development, foreign direct investment, mode of entry into foreign markets.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Intellectual Property</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_474ee285b5155ea7ac7dd2ddc99e8f1c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Drafting a New Consensus on Conscription: Germany Debates the Future of Compulsory Military Service</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00085</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Interrante, Charles Michael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f3609a29f0055fd6918ec4fc82a91633"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_8ef54e056ba32b57088ce421564dcadb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The thesis assesses the current debate in the Federal Republic of Germany over the future of military conscription. Included is a discussion of the early nineteenth-century origins of conscription and a focus on the evolution of compulsory military service in Germany both as a military and social issue after the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany. Emphasis is placed on not only the evolving needs of the Bundeswehr during and since the end of the Cold War but also the question of defense equity (Wehrgerechtigkeit) based on conscription. The thesis contains a detailed survey of the debate within and between the political parties about whether to continue conscription or to establish an alternative basis for military recruitment.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Cold War</subject><subject source="local">Law reform</subject><subject source="local">Military Art and Science</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">Social Policy</subject><subject source="local">War</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c2c4e29933d6d3fde60b2b2f7b2513fe" level="item"><did><unittitle>Strengthening the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons Nonproliferation Regimes</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00086</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jessee, Devin D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ca043c1f2ddceffc11fbdfc24c93df56"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_60a9d8d67bdc9b02605576e69126bf43"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: When the United States eventually ceased negotiations in the United Nations Security Council and invaded Iraq in 2003 with a stated goal of quelling the use or spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) from that country, it became apparent that institutions associated with international security would have to be strengthened in order to assure states that they could effectively orchestrate multilateral measures to counter WMD proliferation. Because of state necessity to first and foremost protect national interest, without more effective international nonproliferation regimes, countries will continue to take unilateral action against perceived WMD threats.  This analysis will briefly survey theory associated with institutions and regimes. It will then analyze the perils posed by WMD, weaknesses of the WMD nonproliferation regimes, and measures being taken or proposed to ameliorate those weaknesses. It will conclude with twelve policy recommendations which, if implemented, would assist in strengthening the worldwide WMD nonproliferation structures.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Biotechnology</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Deterrence (Strategy)</subject><subject source="local">Disarmament</subject><subject source="local">Economic Sanctions</subject><subject source="local">International agencies</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Nuclear nonproliferation</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">Treaties</subject><subject source="local">Technology and State</subject><subject source="local">Technology transfer</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_523f8fac4a6de0e5e85f7dcf977eb4a6" level="item"><did><unittitle>Understanding the Role of Cross Sector Strategic Alliances: An Analysis of Private and Nonprofit Sector Relations</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00087</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Johnson, Lauren C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_832c9d00e2e0afa2dfda8521c765b7fd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_14ba4c2c3f40b5a83634b7a17c53098c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The issue of corporate social responsibility is one of increasing interest for business, nonprofit, and governmental leaders. While it is generally understood that socially conscious practices lead to the improvement in environmental quality, human rights, and overall social well-being, the underlying challenge lies in striking a balance between social and economic longevity. Within most developed countries, and a growing number of developing countries, the three sectors of society (public, private, and nonprofit) traditionally fulfill separate and complementary societal roles. However, over the past two decades, the delineation between the three sectors' responsibilities has blurred, and there is an increasing need and pressure from the general public for changes in the roles of each sector. This paper specifically analyzes the importance of cross-sector alliances between the nonprofit and private sectors and the various levels at which a collaboration can be achieved. It argues that as a result of shifting sectoral roles, strategic alliances between these two sectors are more important now than they have ever been. The paper draws on existing alliance theories and suggests a set of core and secondary characteristics, which are necessary components for any cross-sector alliance. Additionally, this paper applies the postulated model to three case studies to analyze and compare the application of the fundamental characteristics. The paper concludes with recommended future research topics.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Community development</subject><subject source="local">Globalization</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">Management</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b08c338bb260a40224850e54d9c6eeca" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Transformation of the Afghan Refugee: A Study of the Impact of the Displacement Experience on Afghan Women and Children Living in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00088</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Keshavarzian, Ghazal</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7d6d79892298acf1f012faadce67ec4c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_f70ef45e1d5123bb2291f8929e036ca0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: With the goal of better understanding the impact of displacement on refugee communities and its affect on rebuilding efforts back home, this paper maps out the Afghan refugee displacement experience. I examine the impact that displacement has had on Afghan refugees in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan by focusing on two groups: women and children and adolescents. I argue that the period in exile, although disorienting and traumatic, has also had a profound empowering impact on the lives of the Afghan women and, to a lesser extent, children. Both the migration to another state and the experience of living in a host country has altered their way of life.  Interestingly, the refugees in Iran and Pakistan had divergent experiences reflecting the different government refugee policies, composition of refugee community, and cultural, religious, and social values of the host states. I analyze the empowering outcomes of displacement by examining a number of key issues, namely livelihood and economic coping strategies, education, and gender and familial relations of Afghan women and children living in Iran and Pakistan.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Emigration and immigration</subject><subject source="local">Forced migration</subject><subject source="local">Immigrants</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_22c37c391d0d64ec71e4fa2ebea2b9ee" level="item"><did><unittitle>Capital Markets in Emerging Economies: A Case Study of the Nairobi Stock Exchange</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00089</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kibuthu, Grace Wambui</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4e52d74d38a0d124a4342687e163573c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_57bbc28745c2e994f09bd69848c04fbf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Over the past two decades, capital markets in developing countries have experienced a rapid evolution. The aggregate market capitalization of countries classified by the IFC as emerging markets rose from $488 billion in 1988 to $2,225 billion in 1996. Trading on these stock markets rose in similar magnitude, growing from $411 billion to $1,586 billion in that period.  International donors, governments in developed countries and international financial institutions seem to pay more attention to the Asian and Latin American emerging capital markets in contrast to the African markets (particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa) as evidenced by few studies and literature on the development of capital markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study will, therefore, focus on capital market development in Africa, with the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) as a case study. The NSE has continued to increase in importance in economic growth and capital market development in Kenya and the East Africa region. The study will, therefore, explore the path of its development with an emphasis on its structure and organization; rules, regulations and practice; trend in market performance; recent developments; challenges to development; and the way forward in the new millennium. The lessons from this study as well as the recommendations for the future will contribute to the understanding of the development of other capital markets in Africa and other developing regions of the world.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Economics.</subject><subject source="local">Finance</subject><subject source="local">International finance</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cdbf7eae135ad7b60f6a33e443f587e3" level="item"><did><unittitle>U.S. Failures in the Pearl Harbor Attack: Lessons for Intelligence</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00090</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kobayashi, Masahiko</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_08afe99d4191a4e75c13ec70371dc6ce"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_d78fd56c0e9f1af8693e360b4fc00d85"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: In this thesis, I will examine the reasons why the United States failed to prevent the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and will extract lessons from the failure. There were some problems of collection, analysis, and management in the U.S. intelligence. Each defect is not uniquely attributed to the U.S. intelligence per se but is inherent to a cognitive and behavioral limit of human beings. The lessons of Pearl Harbor are not omnipotent tools to prevent a surprise attack, yet they will make a significant contribution to breaking the constraint and will mitigate casualties by enemy attacks. This thesis recommends that intelligence officers should learn the historical lessons at heart to deal with a future contingency.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Intelligence service</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_58a4a1b9eec58fe3d4ec953266e430dc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Imaginging Surprise: Locating the Causality of Strategic Surprise</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00091</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Krishnadas, Devadas</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_141a5fb31729adf95fe383c158637283"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_1744f58b2fb3ddba0a856fa02c4d90d5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The task of this thesis is to investigate and locate the causality of strategic surprise. It argues that causality is located in the function of cognitive rigidities. It uses cases studies to develop the idea of cognitive rigidity. Using the insights from the case studies this thesis will propose three models codifying points of origin of cognitive rigidity. Model A represents cognitive rigidity originating from the adoption of abstract assumptions. Model B represents cognitive rigidity originating from learned historical experience.

Abstract: This MALD thesis asserts that, following its occupation of the Philippines in 1898, the United States attempted an early demonstrable form of public diplomacy, one that, in the general absence of the global communications tools available in Iraq today, emphasized the use of concrete actions and initiatives as a basis of appeal and persuasion to win Filipino support for the Americans and their Philippine policies. Following a discussion of past U.S. military and civilian efforts at public diplomacy in the Philippines, the paper assesses current U.S. public diplomacy efforts in Iraq. Finally, the paper addresses relevance how, if at all, American efforts at public diplomacy in the Philippines might provide some guidance for current U.S. attempts to win hearts and minds in Iraq. This study will demonstrate that, though the U.S. occupation of the Philippines yielded some public diplomacy successes most notably through the work of American teachers the military's need to suppress the Filipino insurrection, and, later, the U.S. political desire to Americanize the islands, undermined public diplomacy efforts, resulting in failures to win the people over.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Communication</subject><subject source="local">Diplomatics</subject><subject source="local">Education</subject><subject source="local">History</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">War</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_34bef72cf7f60fa972f77e74a9659038" level="item"><did><unittitle>Colaborar - Ñamba'apo OÑondivepa - Collaboration: An Analysis of Inter-Agency Collaborations in Developmental Technical Assistance in Paraguay</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00093</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lindenbaum, Stephanie  K</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1573d0a26009e1637c26b940a44c0fa6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b559a9a9f9534aac10ba7a761f7322cf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The United States Peace Corps has paired private American citizens with communities in developing countries for over forty years, yet it suffers a crisis of personality. Created ostensibly for the purpose of aiding developing world peoples, it is frequently criticized for providing a richer and more meaningful experience for the volunteers themselves than for their host communities. This paper examines Peace Corps' history and organizational culture as compared with the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. With the Millennium Challenge Account threatening to alter the way in which USAID conducts development assistance programs abroad, it appears that USAID, like Peace Corps, should perhaps reevaluate its operations, and consider collaborating with other US Government agencies. Through two case studies of Peace Corps Volunteers in Paraguay, this paper looks at how they have worked on USAID-funded projects, and how this collaborative effort may be an attractive model for the future.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Community development</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">International agencies</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6284fe08241220b2b9bb8190f8793083" level="item"><did><unittitle>Evaluating Transitional Justice Mechanismsí Effect on Reconciliation: Case Study Sierra Leone</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00094</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Loizou, Elaina</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_be069dd4d04141f181253da6848aa506"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e7105ae5b553b3549f1cbac4db2cc88b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: In situations of identity-based conflicts and their post-conflict transformation, what ought to occur is the depoliticizing of conflicting identities because those should not be enshrined legally as a sole political reality. The depoliticizing of conflicting identities, and consequently transformation of conflict, will take place through the societal re-conceptualizing of political identity and broadening of the concept of power through redefining the cultural and political discourse. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of depoliticizing group identities, the study utilizes the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I propose for Bosnia to undertake the re-making of its constitution as an initial step toward depoliticizing wartime identities. The recommendation of this study is for the population to be actively engaged in constitutional change through popular participation which will take place in a two stage process, civic education and popular consultation.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Ethnic relations</subject><subject source="local">Peace</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cbe41bcbebe26a9edad6cc607b86fee2" level="item"><did><unittitle>How Marketing Mumbo Jumbo Can Help Poor Countries Grow: The Case of 100% Columbian Coffee</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00096</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Marti, Rafael</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1c537ab8ae887c6d02dac038f8786419"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ec5033b98fce5344988c601e0526d5b7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This work starts with an overview of the consequences of falling prices in manufactures for developing countries and the role marketing and country branding can play in promoting exports to high income countries, where differentiated products are sold with high margins. To understand how branding works, the second chapter presents a summary of scientific findings regarding the psychological dimension of branding, focusing on the role emotions play; it also analyses the main traits of today's branding. Building upon this framework, chapters III and IV, review the case of the 100&amp;#x0025; Colombian Coffee campaign, and examine its brand equity, history, and recent development. As a conclusion, some guidelines are given to poor countries in order to take advantage of marketing techniques when exporting to the US and Europe.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Communications</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Globalization</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject><subject source="local">Management</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e9271b578d206a0b93b0b203fca45f21" level="item"><did><unittitle>Revealed Preferences in US Bilateral Aid, 1960-2000</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00097</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mazzotta, Ben</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d8d95d3efaa17f102509a8760424714b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_bb56c3ea01acbcb25a8b0b1061ab98ab"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper proposes and evaluates determinants of US bilateral foreign aid. An earlier cross-country comparison of donors (Alesina and Dollar, 1998) suggested two determinants that offer limited explanatory power as determinants of bilateral aid flows: colonial relationships and political ties. As the US has no colonial relationships, the former makes no prediction of US bilateral aid spending. The latter is measured by proxy in Alesina and Dollar's work, through the correlation of UN votes between donor and recipient. As they acknowledge, this measure potentially suffers from reverse causality (Alesina and Dollar, 1998). I offer four hypotheses for determinants of US bilateral aid spending:  1. Trade ties with the recipient country.  2. Operations of the US military,  3. Political events in the recipient country, and  4. Economic events in the recipient country, In order to test these hypotheses, I use data from the USAID Green Book, which specifies types of spending including military and economic assistance, and modalities of spending including loans and grants (USAID 2002). The Green Book data are the dependent variables in cross-sectional regressions on indicators of governments political leanings and democratic performance, indicators of economic health, the presence of a named US military operation, and indicators of economic relationships with the US. Indicators of governments' political leanings come from the World Bank's Database of Political Institutions. Democratic performance comes from the Polity variable in the Polity IV dataset from the University of Maryland's Integrated Network for Societal Conflict Research. Indicators of economic health are found in the Penn World Table, from the University of Pennsylvania's Center for International Comparisons. The list of named US military operations comes from Global Security, a Washington think tank. The closeness of economic ties with the US is measured with the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics historic series. The specific composition of the variables and controls is listed below in the section 'Data'. The regressions in Tables 1 to 4 assess the revealed preferences of the US foreign aid programs in aggregate. Washington allocates bilateral aid to countries that are trading partners, that are poorer, that are secular, and that have strong nationalist executive parties. US bilateral aid rises in response to adverse economic shocks. US bilateral aid falls in real per capita terms over time. Economic assistance, and specifically USAID spending, is highest when centrists and nationalists control the executive branch. Economic assistance shies away from countries with major religious parties. Contrary to popular opinion, Washington (on an intercontinental, decades-long scale) does not lavish aid on right-wing governments, nor does it systematically undermine the left.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Comparative government</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Diplomatics</subject><subject source="local">Economic assistance</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Economic policy</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Regional planning</subject><subject source="local">War</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_89b5d02a37af8fca1de413668bac2168" level="item"><did><unittitle>China's Banking System and How Citibank Can Capitalize on its Liberalization</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00098</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">McGeehan, Kevin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_73918d128e49f9f6ff2c9f88b6447be3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_21682b5dbf99912cd4d165b3ba53e049"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The potential that China's economy holds as it moves to a more liberal market economy is limitless, and Western firms are eager to become the first movers in their industries to take advantage of this promise. Western banks are no exception. Chinese regulations have historically limited the operations of foreign banks, but with the entry of China into the World Trade Organization, that is all slated to change - in theory. Geographic limitations for foreign banks are to be lifted by December 2006, along with a host of other restrictions that have retarded the growth of these Western banks and the Chinese banking sector as a whole. Progress on these liberalizations has been slow, however, and Chinese regulators have even put other limitations in place that will hurt competition in the long run. This is far from the only problem facing the Chinese banking sector. Decades of policy lending have saddled the four state-owned banks with an unhealthy level of non-performing loans from state-owned enterprises. Asset management companies have been created to manage these NPLs, but the situation is far from stable. A lack of corporate governance has also created an environment where management of banks is opaque and corruption widespread. The risks inherent in this industry are great. In this environment then, what is Citigroup's best method of operation? Once reentry to the market was allowed, Citigroup pushed hard to maintain its control in China by avoiding joint ventures and operating independently. As this strategy stalled and its competitors gained the upper hand in the country, Citibank changed its approach to embrace joint ventures and entertain the idea of buying into the state bank system. Is this the right approach? Citibank is right to pursue joint ventures at this time, especially because building its own structures in China would be cost-prohibitive and too slow to develop.  At the same time, the bank must be careful with whom it associates in China. The possibility of corruption or mismanagement is still significant with regard to partnerships with state-owned banks. It also cannot expand its offerings too quickly or expose itself to too much risk. It should use its government connections to speed up the deregulation process, plan for the time when this becomes a reality, and train native Chinese workers in Western bank practices. Citibank is currently not the most successful foreign bank in China; that title belongs to HSBC. A combination of prudent growth and innovative service upgrades should allow Citibank to compete with and eventually overtake its rival in this burgeoning market.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Government business enterprises</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject><subject source="local">Privatization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1ceea155bca6cf71c455cb1213b0c4ba" level="item"><did><unittitle>Toward a More Sustainable Democracy: Public Participation in Justice Sector Reform</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00099</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mcilvain, Ashley</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2c360eb4263704f0401c477b245ee37a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e8ee8f598a2e0945b481393fe4184eaf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: In both researching and participating in the process of planning and implementing rule of law reforms, I saw several trends that seemed to indicate a need for change. It is these themes that have guided the development of this paper and my hopes of its application in future rule of law promotion efforts. The experience of donors and practitioners in countries around the world in recent years has illustrated that: Reforms led by international donors do not always coincide with local priorities or needs; Institutional reforms often unravel after the international community's departure due to a lack of domestic capacity or support; The broader public is often excluded from and disillusioned with the reform process; Reforms do not always adequately address the need to develop a participatory tradition or the existing public cynicism about democratic participation in government. Certainly, these are themes already raised by a wide range of scholars and practitioners. Current wisdom now dictates that: Development of both the process and content of reforms should include local input and be subject to local control; Local capacity-building should be a priority in the reform process from the outset; Civic education is a necessary antecedent to effective democratic participation; The reform process itself is equally as important as its final product in determining the legitimacy of the institutions it creates.  Even among those that agree with these points, the question remains as to how these goals can be most effectively accomplished. The research and program analysis I present here examines how public participation in rule of law reform may complement existing initiatives to help achieve these goals. Such an approach is certainly not immune to critique. Many international donors, state governments and publics alike are skeptical about either the value or efficacy of public participation in government reform and work, not least because it remains a new field of exploration with little empirical evidence to support it. There is, however, much anecdotal evidence of state and local reforms of the police and judiciary where public involvement was a key component in building public trust in the reform process and the government, increasing the legitimacy of the police and judiciary, and improving the accountability and effectiveness of these institutions. Through the analysis and examples included in this study, I have attempted to provide an objective assessment of the potential benefits and drawbacks of a participatory approach, raising issues relevant to international and state actors considering whether to integrate public participation in their particular reforms. I have also sought to address how civic education and gradual public engagement may be used to reduce public cynicism and reticence toward democratic participation. In vetting the rationale, opportunities and practical challenges to such participation, it is my hope that the initiatives discussed here may be successfully integrated into current and future reform programs to provide a more holistic approach to rule of law promotion in new democracies.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil law</subject><subject source="local">Comparative government</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">International agencies</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject><subject source="local">Intervention (International law)</subject><subject source="local">Law reform</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">Social Policy</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a3e023d85a7d1e4b7e83dea141822d28" level="item"><did><unittitle>Reducing Refugee Rights?

Abstract: There is a stark contrast between the ever expanding body of international law which addresses the protection of refugees and the imposition of increased restrictions due to stringent state policies and practices which refugees face in host countries. Expanding refugee protection at the international level takes the form of new covenants and declarations, increasing numbers of signatories on and ratifications of existing instruments, and regional agreements between groups of states. On the other hand, policies and practices of refugee hosting governments have sometimes led to a curbing of refugees' rights. Some countries, which at one time had quite friendly approaches toward refugees, have scaled back their liberal practices and reduced the rights afforded to refugees. This thesis aims to better understand the factors that are leading host countries to shift their policies and practices toward refugees from liberal to stringent. The paper will focus on developing countries, particularly in Africa, which have signed onto refugee rights instruments and have, at one time, had relatively liberal stances toward acceptance and treatment of refugees. Through an exploration of two case studies - Guinea and Mozambique - the drive behind the states' shift from liberal policies and practices, which limit the rights of refugees within their borders, will be explored. In short, this paper addresses the research question: what are the main factors which drive states to shift from liberal to stringent policies and practices towards refugees?</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Forced migration</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c20dd0c28c02021d7ed1415bc1082f95" level="item"><did><unittitle>Diplomatic Investments</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00101</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Molloy, Michael Sean</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_72aac294ec08a5af67d74927d24bfcdd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_8f904b12993aa4aa2591e468a41b1f17"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper argues that the aims of American and Chinese commercial policies promoting foreign direct investment (FDI) have been successfully aligned with the effects of their implementation; private sector interests have complemented and reinforced the commercial policy intentions of both nations to encourage development while at the same time helping to promote the peaceful resolution of bilateral tensions. This successful alignment of governmental policies and business interests has given rise to diplomatic investments, which continue to play a role in defining opportunities for stable and productive mutual gains for both countries. The study begins with an overview of the current state of economic integration between the U.S. and China, identifying some of the key benefits which the implementation of diplomatic investments have brought to the bilateral relationship in terms of economic development and political stabilization. This dual advantage of effectively implemented pro-FDI commercial policies is further elaborated on through a blending of both realism and complex interdependence frameworks; a combination of both theories is used as a complementary means for analyzing this dynamic. A brief historical account of commercial policies is then provided in an attempt to demonstrate a positive correlation between pro-FDI policy implementation and non-violent conflict on the one hand, and instances of armed conflict during periods devoid of such policy initiatives on the other. A statistical analysis is next undertaken to demonstrate how the FDI policy implementation process has created a framework for cooperation which enables private sector interests to naturally promote a more stable and productive framework for economic interdependence. The changes brought about by increased economic integration have made both countries increasingly vulnerable to a prolonged cessation of bilateral commercial activity, further reinforcing both national and private sector interests in building a stronger structure for the peaceful resolution of conflict. These theoretical, historical, and statistical interpretations of the pro-FDI policymaking process are then applied to three case studies in which recent potentially violent crisis situations were peacefully resolved. Explanations for the peaceful resolutions of the Taiwan Strait Crisis of March, 1996, the Chinese Embassy bombing in Belgrade in May, 1999, and the EP-3 Incident of April, 2001 would all be incomplete without an appreciation for the pacifying role played by government commercial policies and the market forces they helped to unleash through the promotion of foreign investments. Expert testimonies regarding each case are included to demonstrate that policymakers, academics, and business leaders alike recognize the importance of FDI in promoting cooperative resolutions to the geopolitical conflicts in question. The paper concludes by stating that the successful management of the bilateral commercial policymaking process contributes to peaceful, non-violent diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China because economic security for both countries has become increasingly tied to the continuance of structurally interdependent trade and investment. As long as economic growth is maintained and both countries continue to benefit from FDI exchanges, these current trends are likely to continue.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1a35bb994a821002daf884fd30e3546f" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Dual Imperative to Enhance National Security and Foster Human Rights: The United Nations and the Adoption of Resolution 1373</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00102</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Morarji, Maitri</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8ea49db157b534741878413775619e7e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_1853a7eb1ab7f1197326e33972766951"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: On September 28th, 2001, the United Nations (hereafter, the UN) Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1373, through which it codified abstract and specific rules pertaining to terrorism which are obligatory and binding on all member states. While mainstream discourse has pointed to the opportunities provided by Resolution 1373 to build a consistent and coherent global anti-terrorism regime, international human rights advocates have raised grave concerns over its sanctioning of human rights violations by state authorities under the guise of countering terrorism. This dually descriptive and prescriptive paper will investigate the impact of Resolution 1373 on the global human rights regime, its actors, and its institutions by exploring the following three questions: 1) Does the mandate of UN Security Council Resolution 1373 pose a threat to the international human rights regime?; 2) What precedent does the Security Council's legislative act set?; and, 3) Do the implementation and enforcement mechanisms, and obligations contained within Resolution 1373 condone state behavior that is ultimately detrimental to states' citizens? By examining the philosophical, structural, and functional components, as well as the political factors that led to the establishment of Resolution 1373, the study proposes that the resolution poses a threat to the international human rights regime by providing states with the fa&amp;#x00E7;ade of UN sanction to implement sweeping anti-terrorism measures. Albeit lofty in its objective to build a global standard to assist states in taking practical measures to prevent the scourge of terrorism both domestically and internationally, the Security Council and the institutions of Resolution 1373 lack the current capacity to monitor states' compliance in a manner that recognizes and reinforces global human rights norms. Through the adoption of Resolution 1373, the Security Council circumvented the traditional use of treaties and conventions to develop broadly-agreed upon international norms under the guise of multilateralism, and essentially provided an avenue for US unilateral assertions. More honest multilateral endeavors provide the only true mechanism to foster a more holistic conception of security that seeks to protect citizens from the vastly complex threats to their human security, including those posed by the threat of terrorism.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a5f5f8a2d5e40ac049f3ceef02c722df" level="item"><did><unittitle>An International Institutionalist Approach to the Globalization of Emerging Infectious Diseases</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00103</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nieto, Andres Alejandro</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_89911364f4ddd30cfe69b68264159e3d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_de9230a56af330e1d1da486088012576"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Globalization is often discussed in the context of economics, through telecommunications, international trade, manufacturing strategies, and global capital flow. Whether or not a state is democratically elected, the effects of globalization are more often than not seen yielding state sovereignty to industrialists, investment bankers, media moguls and other transnational actors. Over the past forty years these processes of globalization have caused a dramatic increase in the emergence and reemergence of more deadly forms of infectious disease. Professor David Fidler asserts that because of the eroding boundaries between and within states, the effects of globalization have undermined that ability of sovereign states to protect their citizens from emerging infectious diseases in the conventional ways. The unprecedented speed of the spread of infectious disease has eroded the distinction between national and international public health. While politicians, scholars and business leaders recognize that the forces of globalization are among the most potent at work within late twentieth century international relations, they have yet to realize the extent to which the evolving boundaries of state sovereignty in the global community will affect the spread and combat of emerging infectious disease (EID).  Infectious diseases more readily cross borders as a result of the proliferation of interstate travel and trade, this increases contact among humans with dissimilar immune capacities and facilitates the transmission of disease by increasing the availability of vulnerable hosts. This has raised concerns that have threatened the international state system for centuries. In the 14th Century, quarantine procedures were first introduced to help curb the impact of infectious agents carried aboard commercial ships. While commercial shipping remains a channel for disease transmission, air travel has raised new and more complex dangers with respect to transmission. Poor air circulation aboard international flights can infect an entire flight with respiratory viruses such as SARS, and air travel facilitates the spread of highly contagious hemorrhagic viruses such as the Ebola virus of central Africa, as well as Mad Cow disease and other prion-like illnesses that could be transmitted on the shoes of contaminated individuals. The structure of the state system with its focus on sovereignty further complicates the challenges posed by the spread of infectious disease.  Traditionally, state sovereignty has protected the way individual states regulate their physicians and pharmaceuticals, thus keeping international regulation at bay. With few enforceable incentives to cooperate and regulate antibiotics, private actors mismanage and overuse antibiotics. More often than not antibiotics are over prescribed, sold over the counter, or sold on the black market. Overuse of antibiotics dramatically increases the extent to which microbial agents develop resistance in the developing world, this overuse has contributed to increased resistance in such cases as malaria, tuberculosis, and more recently, syphilis. Beyond the added challenge of drug resistance there are the socioeconomic concerns that follow when new microbes proliferate in developing countries. Although early warning mechanisms might protect other states in the immediate future, they have the potential to destroy the already unsteady economies of the developing states by engendering fear among tourists. This not only makes it more difficult to combat the disease, but also provides a disincentive for states to warn people of emerging illness. The current international health regulation policies of the World Health Organization have met limited success. The WHO, does not have the necessary enforcement power to effectively combat the newly emerging illnesses that pose the greatest threat to the world community. International health institutions have yet to neither develop the necessary resources nor take advantage of the international institutional mechanisms available to meet their public health goals. I will argue that through the development of global public policy (GPP) networks in the context of the international institutionalist approach, laid out by Robert Keohane, one will not only strike the necessary balance between the protection of state sovereignty and the protection of the health of individual citizens, but also find the most effective and efficient approach. In the following section, I will discuss the relevant international theoretical approaches to enforcement of international rules and regulations, in order to describe the framework and policy guidelines that have lead to my conclusions about the effectiveness of GPP networks as they apply to EID. In section II, I will discuss to origins and nature of the threat posed by EID along with the current economic and social implications. In section III, I will discuss three internationally significant EIDs, how they are spread, describe the globally significant consequences of such threats and how GPP networks can not only help to limit disease proliferation but pool together valuable resources that can facilitate the finding of a cure. Finally in section IV, I will summarize the GPP approach, and describe its future potential.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Organizations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2dfdc45cf29ce4b756bda65758657a95" level="item"><did><unittitle>Alliance for Progress or Alianza Para El Progreso?

Abstract: This thesis argues that the origins of the Alliance for Progress, despite having been extensively studied and written about, have not been portrayed with full accuracy. I argue that this was the case because students of the Alliance have approached it largely as a policy of the United States government, what, in turn, resulted in a series of conclusions that misrepresented the origins of the Alliance for Progress by assigning the wrong relative importance to the different factors that played a role in its creation. By redefining the Alliance as what it really was, an inter-American policy, and approaching the study of its origins, including its Latin American origins, I reassess the origins of the Alliance for Progress. I show that, contrary to what it is generally believed, the Alliance's main purpose was not only or even mainly to prevent the spread of communist revolutions and Soviet infiltration in Latin America but to genuinely pull the region out of economic, social and political despair. I also demonstrate that the most important characteristic of the Alliance's nature was not its magnitude as a foreign aid program but the revolutionary features of its policy prescriptions. As a consequence, I establish that the Alliance's most important conceptual foundation was not a new theory of foreign aid in the United States but the rich, sophisticated and influential Latin America structuralist school of thought. Moreover, even regarding its dimension as a major foreign aid program, I show that the original idea about the need for a more engaged participation of the United States in inter-American affairs, accompanied by a more generous commitment of funds, also originated in Latin America.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Cold War</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic assistance</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">History</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Land use</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Poverty</subject><subject source="local">Social Policy</subject><subject source="local">Technology transfer</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_839ccc2b129f5210577c81719eddcb5a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards 'Peace Writ Large'?: Use of Evaluation in Assessing the Impact of Israeli/Palestinian Peace Education</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00105</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ross, Karen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_37eeecd71b7eba61dd26c72b95e99a3c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7efdacb70334fb84b6d3f7cbc8c03db6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: According to multiple political scientists, there is a direct correlation between the heterogeneity of a country's population and the potential for ethnic politicization and violence. In the face of such heterogeneity, governments face various options to limit the potential damage, including forming a national identity which transcends ethnic bonds; instituting a policy of assimilation; and following a program of exclusion. Given the relatively recent appearance of Macedonia in its modern form, its ability to create a national identity which would encompass all ethnic groups found within its borders was extremely hindered. Additionally, there was a historic use of forced assimilation and harsher forms of homogenization in the Balkans. When faced, therefore, with Albanian nationalism in the 1980s and 1990s, Macedonia's following a program of assimilation and exclusion was understandable and predictable. Via policies such as educational reform, restrictions on language and family size, and economic, cultural, and political exclusion, the Macedonian Government attempted to counteract Albanian nationalism. The Macedonian Slav majority, however, was unable to bring the desired results of their exclusionary and assimilative policies to fruition. The Albanian minority's most innocuous resistance involved boycotts to peaceful protests, while the more violent ranged from the throwing of rocks to acts of terrorism. In fact, the ethnic Albanian resistance almost resulted in the dissolution of Macedonia by means of a referendum on Albanian autonomy and the subsequent declaration of the independent republic of Ilirida. Although the initial aim of the policies of assimilation and exclusion was to shore up Macedonia's political and territorial integrity, the result was almost the opposite; Macedonia was on the brink of civil war by 2001. This essay will analyze the rationale behind the Macedonian government's policies, the methods of Albanian resistance, and an explanation of the failure of government policy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil rights</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Ethnic relations</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">Minorities</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">Social Policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4832d31c69f59651bfe4a95340a6ea61" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Strategic Corporal and the Emerging Battlefield:  The Nexus between the USMC's Three Block War Concept and Network Centric Warfare</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00107</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Szepesy, James E</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_87ad5916b7013961e122f85ea721da05"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_aff4e94c14ac50de3f0f9b4bd3130c2d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The modern international security environment has undergone significant changes since the end of the Cold War.  The U.S. Marine Corps, recognizing the changing landscape of war, articulated its vision of future warfare as the Three Block War. Concurrent to Marine Corps conceptualization of the Three Block War was an explosive growth in information technology developments. These developments, along with demands to reduce military spending, combined with the changing face of war to generate tremendous pressure upon the US military establishment to adapt. Emerging from these pressures was a desire to operationalize the information technology advancements realized at the end of the 20th Century in what is being called Network Centric Warfare. These two vectors, refining the Three Block War model and Network Centric Warfare, have come to be important elements to the strategies and tactics used in Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom as well as components to the consequent debate about the appropriate future structure and composition of the U.S. military. The convergence of the Three Block War and Network Centric Warfare has led to renewed importance and significance of individual actions on the battlefield, the rebirth of the Strategic Corporal for 21st Century warfare if you will. The nexus of the Three Block War, Network Centric Warfare, and the Strategic Corporal have been put to the test in Iraq.  In the fight for Fallujah, the small unit leader emerged as a center of gravity. His ability to affect the tactical level had strategic implications. To maximize the positive effects of these small unit leaders, the Marines developed their strategy to integrate the Three Block War principles with Network Centric Warfare concepts. They used the training concepts developed for the Three Block War and augmented them with the equipment developed for Network Centric Warfare. The result was tantamount to a human network centered on the small unit leader, the Strategic Corporal.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8a5905690ebb648fa1110c8b3440a91e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Interpreting the Enemy: A Game Theoretic Model of Conflict with Applications to the Korean and Iraq Wars</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00108</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Thompson, Stephen W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_36f214d4152c7d36688f1a4ededca44b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ca18d2bbd6bef59e236398f7452a490e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This report presents a game theoretic model of conflict and applies it to the Korean and Iraq Wars. The model segments international conflict into impasse, event, interpretation, challenge, and counterinterpretation phases. If a nation's leaders are frustrated in their efforts to mobilize resources against a perceived security menace, they will interpret an unexpected security event to resolve the impasse in their favor, even if the evidence linking the menace with the agent causing the event is weak.  The leaders are likely to challenge the menace in an effort to validate their interpretation. The challenge will be widely counterinterpreted as a belligerent act, mobilizing support against the challenging nation. The agent should provoke the security event if it believes that the leaders will issue the challenge, and if it stands to gain enough from the mobilization of support. In Korea, the Truman administration was frustrated in its efforts to obtain resources to rearm the United States against the Soviet menace. When North Korea invaded South Korea, the administration linked the event to the Soviets, effectively resolving the impasse in its favor. It then went on to challenge the Soviets, protecting the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan from attack by the Soviet-allied Communist Chinese, and leading a multinational force that drove the North Koreans out of South Korea and invaded North Korea itself. The intervention and invasion were seen as belligerent acts, and the Communist Chinese mobilized to North Korea's support, driving the U.S.-led forces essentially back to the original border between North and South Korea, where the war stagnated. The Truman administration managed to triple the defense budget, while the North Koreans won a crucial ally, gains that arguably outweighed the costs of carnage. In Iraq, the Bush administration desired to simultaneously cut taxes and increase military spending. When the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 occurred, the administration was quick to impute a linkage between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, and to argue that the Iraqis had advanced in a program to produce weapons of mass destruction, which might slip into the terrorists hands. The Bush administration challenged Saddam Hussein to either disarm or be invaded.  The ultimatum was partially supported by the United Nations Security Council, but the U.S. and a coalition of the willing eventually invaded Iraq without a U.N. mandate. The decision, compounded by the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction or al Qaeda linkage, has caused much of the world to counterinterpret the U.S. as a belligerent power, eroding its international legitimacy and increasing sympathy for bin Laden among Muslims. The Bush administration had its cake and ate it too, a tax cut and a massive increase in defense spending while from bin Laden's perspective, Muslims fighters have engaged U.S. troops in bloody and prolonged insurgencies, particularly in Iraq, and al Qaeda's support base among networked, radical Muslims has broadened and deepened.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Cold War</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Deterrence (Strategy)--History</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Leadership</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Negotiation</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">War</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_704f0af4e678635174ad3c42b0af347a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Branding America: An Examination of U.S. Public Diplomacy Efforts After September 11, 2001</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00109</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tiedeman, Anna K.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e2ca8bb4ccc9a7c44e9cf4978ac4ca99"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_deb553e283af6f0e52eb8ce8f44c37af"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper explores the public diplomacy efforts of the United States after September 11, 2001 within the context of public diplomacy theory to make the case that the application of the private sector marketing technique of branding was not the sole reason the campaigns failed. Using the efforts of Under Secretary of State Charlotte Beers as a case study, I will explain why her case proves the U.S. needs to dramatically shift its public diplomacy efforts from crisis management in the Middle East to a global emphasis on building relationships in the future. In this paper, I explore the concepts of public diplomacy and branding to uncover the similarities that may have proved useful and the differences that may have spelled disaster ultimately concluding that the failure of the public diplomacy campaigns under Beers had less to do with the application of branding techniques to public policy and more to do with institutional, cultural and political factors. The paper concludes with prescriptions for the future conduct of U.S. public diplomacy advocating the need to take a long-term global perspective and to back away from short term myopically focused crisis management in a region where the U.S. Government is not a credible messenger. To restore this lost credibility, a two-way system of communication and understanding needs to be implemented through public diplomacy around the world.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Communication</subject><subject source="local">Diplomatics</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_315fe3e94482d643805bce04cc57bfc6" level="item"><did><unittitle>'10+3' Mechanism and its Development: A Comparative Analysis with the EU Experience</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00110</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wang, Genhua</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e24b075b3794bd50848fe227ab2fe9fe"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_d967701dbb47ae434146c62ba8f21be5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Compared with the high integration level of Europe Union, 10+3 mechanism is still in its very preliminary period of promoting East Asia regionalization; and it probably won't reach the level of EU in the foreseeable future, owing to different driving forces and constraints in the two regions. One of the major elements that guarantee EU achievement is said to be the homogeneity of democratic system in each member country, which 10+3 mechanism is going to lack for quite some time in the future. On the other hand, the willingness of promoting regionalization manifested by East Asia countries derives more from the desire for economic stability and continuing growth, in contrast with the longing for permanent security in West European countries in the early 50s. Different constraints and motivations determine the different path of integration in these two regions. With all the differences, there are some interesting similarities between the development of 10+3 and the early EU experience. To name only a few, 10+3 was born out of the East Asia financial crisis, while European integration came after the scourge of World War II; Before the initiation of Free Trade Agreements (FTA) were put on the table, there was an episode of Bilateral Monetary Swap Agreements in East Asia, in contrast with that of Coal and Steel Community in Europe before it started building a common market. Taking into account all the similarities and differences, a comparative analysis of these two integration processes might produce some useful findings for future development of 10+3 mechanism. This thesis, when combing the evolution and projecting the future of 10+3 process, tries to explore similarities and differences of these two integration process, for the purpose of extracting useful EU integration experiences while recognizing specific distinctions and constraints in East Asia. The thesis basically consists of four parts. The first part explores the genesis and evolution of 10+3 and theoretical diagnosis of its driving force. The second part addresses the two crucial steps of 10+3: the financial cooperation and the initiation of various FTAs across the region. The third part set forth the development of institution building, security cooperation in the framework. The fourth part argues that regional relations with United States will be indispensable in the future. The concluding part discusses various uncertainties on the development of 10+3.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Comparative government</subject><subject source="local">Diplomatics</subject><subject source="local">Economic policy</subject><subject source="local">European Union</subject><subject source="local">Finance</subject><subject source="local">Globalization</subject><subject source="local">History</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Organizations</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">Treaties</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a9b291c2e6403a793407b6e099a76567" level="item"><did><unittitle>Crossroads in Sino-Japanese Relations: Exploring the Impact of Anti-Japanese Sentiment on Japanese Firms' Business Relations in China</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00111</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wang, Jane W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_208cbdb5430cc6349d985fc92f5d5656"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_23939bd1f5f90be6a1983c69b2c5470b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Do unresolved historical tensions negatively affect current business relations between countries? This paper explores the question of whether popular anti-Japanese sentiment in China impacts Japanese firms' business relations in China. Drawing on relevant history, current trends, and key conceptual frameworks, the paper seeks to interpret the discrepant evidence from cases, media accounts, research studies, quantitative data and interviews with practitioners, which present contradictory portraits of the impact from anti-Japanese sentiment on Japanese firms in China.  Upon analysis, it is found that national identity its salience, associated social norms, and encouragement of activism is the determining factor in driving the public expression of anti-Japanese sentiment in action in the business realm. In private transactions, however, where the benefit and cost to the immediate actors involved are of primary consideration, Chinese business behavior tends to be driven more by rational choice than by national identity. Thus, the impact of anti-Japanese sentiment on business relations represents the sensational exceptions rather than the general rule.  Nevertheless, anti-Japanese sentiment carries real risks for Japanese firms in China, which may heighten if anti-Japanese national identity salience is sustained at the current high level. At a crossroads in Sino-Japanese relations, the quantifiable impact of historical grievances through the negative effects of anti-Japanese sentiment on current business relations may as yet prompt a final reckoning of the past between the two great powers of Asia.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Diplomatics</subject><subject source="local">History</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Reconciliation</subject><subject source="local">War</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_80b1bb45805298b19aa5ef73c403cf94" level="item"><did><unittitle>Renewable Development: The Economics and Policies that Drive Wind Energy Development</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00112</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wolfe, Matthew R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2005">2005</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8ee602a2c26032854429635ad51f6298"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_743e9215450ce1fc7a1e4293a0b7e73f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Renewable Development: The Economics and Policies that Drive Wind Energy Development is a business plan that was also submitted to the Tufts Frigon Social Entreprenuership Competition.

Abstract: Zimbabwe is currently a country in crisis politically and economically. President Robert Mugabe's extreme policies against the opposition have led to Zimbabwe's international isolation. Within Africa, however, Mugabe has largely been shielded from criticism. The framing of his campaign against the opposition within the rhetoric of anti-colonialism has created a veil of legitimacy behind which Mugabe has been free to act. This paper argues that Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party have habitually used ethnic conflict as a self-serving political weapon in Zimbabwe. It first develops a two-tiered theoretical framework within which the case of Zimbabwe can analyzed. It then analyzes three case studies in which Mugabe utilized ethnic conflict to neutralize political opposition: the campaign against the Zimbabwe African People's Union (1982-1987); the legitimization of the seizure of white-owned farms by ex-combatants (1998-2005); and the repression of the Movement for Democratic Change (2000-2006).</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Ethnic relations</subject><subject source="local">Minorities</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0bb16b57493d3ea19eaa882eb9ed8c6e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Gender Roles in Refugee Camps: The Lasting Impact of Refugee Interventions in Tanzania</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00114</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brown, Gordon K.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2b0df848fe543c4e793f6f4a49c9dda8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6b3538b43c11e5b7b3d14787a4f2bb43"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The foundation of the African household lies in the relationship between men and women. This thesis explores how this fundamental relationship is affected by humanitarian assistance in refugee camps that promotes gender equality. The analysis of returnees' perceptions of gender relations suggests that changes engendered by the promotion of gender equality in refugee camps are not permanent. However, it is possible that the exposure to the idea of gender equality may contribute to the overall presence of these ideas in the minds of Burundians. Thus in the long term, interventions may in fact contribute to changes in Burundian gender roles and its development.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Forced migration</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian intervention</subject><subject source="local">International agencies</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_8c9841fde7e7e40bdee3a55ab546f01c" level="item"><did><unittitle>On Our Own: Unilateralism in Israeli-Policymaking</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00115</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Davis, John D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0062cda23c2a067d9343253b2fa0513d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3afbdc1427209a151092de273150ffcb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Israeli policy-makers have turned towards unilateralism as opposed to bilateral diplomacy as a means to manage the security crisis stemming from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This thesis seeks to analyze and present what type of Palestinian State would be in Israel's best interest and to analyze and present the benefits and costs of unilateralism versus other policy options such as diplomacy. Analytic models, including game theory, focused on case studies such as the Disengagement from Gaza and the terrorism of Hamas. In addition, opportunities and obstacles for mediation by the United States were analyzed and the leadership strategies and styles of Ariel Sharon were compared with those of Ehud Olmert. The conclusions drawn by this study are that to be effective from the Israeli perspective, a Palestinian State must not present a security threat, nor a demographic threat, and be permanent and stable. Unilateral policies can lead Israel closer to this end-state, including a long-term interim Palestinian State with Provisional Borders, but ultimately only bilateral negotiation will lead to a permanent two-state solution to the conflict.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Leadership</subject><subject source="local">Negotiation</subject><subject source="local">Peace</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_36e19b70ca6b5925feca60d9fb72f041" level="item"><did><unittitle>Foreign Tourism in Brazil: Is the Sky the Limit?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00116</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dixon, Andrew D.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_77eef3a2a78b50ec127095963020edb8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_2dd43b1db1fe87a839f053c8b54633b5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The Federal Republic of Brazil is a vast expanse of natural beauty that is just waiting to be discovered by foreign tourists. The country has what foreign tourists want: miles of deserted beaches, unspoiled natural beauty, a vibrant people and culture, and an infectious lightness of heart. Foreign tourism is strong, but has the potential to skyrocket off the charts. Why has this not happened yet? It is a promotional issue in that most foreign tourists have not been informed yet of the splendor that awaits them. Thus, the federal government has initiated a promotional branding campaign with the goal of showing the beauty of Brazil to the world. Such efforts are a good start, but deep challenges exist that must be overcome if the foreign tourism industry is to reach its massive potential. Some of these issues are more societal and others are simply a result of a lack of attention. Nevertheless, the federal government faces a considerable task as it must fight the tourism battle on two fronts. Internationally, it must continue to push ahead with its branding campaign in order for the world to see Brazil in the best possible light. Domestically, it must deal with the various problems faced by the foreign tourism industry. If successful, the future of foreign tourism in Brazil is certain to be bright. In this paper, I attempt to analyze the present state of the foreign tourism industry in Brazil, examine the hurdles that it faces, and then present recommendations for how to improve the industry. I begin with a background description of foreign tourism in Brazil. I then look at the role of tourism in the country's foreign direct investment. I next explain the concept of state branding and describe how the Brazilian government is using branding as a tool to enhance the county's image abroad. Following this, I investigate the difficulties faced by Brazil's foreign tourism industry, and conclude with recommendations for how the government can attract a greater number of foreign tourists.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Communication</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Government business enterprises</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject><subject source="local">Poverty</subject><subject source="local">Public policy</subject><subject source="local">Social Policy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4ee40aa8a48776915b7bc32ff9096d9c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Industrial Policy Options for Developing Countries: The Case of the Automotive Sector in Thailand &amp; Malaysia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00117</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fuangkajonsak, Wanrawee</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5887949a932ff1b6872894f2bbde54e1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_07f2b0812d029cdceeb220d8acc988de"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Industrial policies are formulated in order to guide the course of economic development. In a country whose government has industrial policies, the market force is more or less distorted due to government intervention. It can also be the case that the government uses industrial policy to correct market distortion resulted from domestic monopoly. However, there is no uniformity in the essence or the extent of industrial policies. Different paths chosen by the governments lead to different patterns of industrial development. Even similar strategies could bring about different results when implemented under different environments. This thesis focuses on the policy options for developing countries in particular. The options studied here are the extent of the government's involvement in industrial development. The case study of the automotive sector in Thailand and Malaysia reveals that Malaysian state entrepreneurship, through the national car projects, hinders the development of the industry competitiveness. When the government gets involved in production, domestic competition is limited in order to protect its interests. Thus, the protected producers are not under pressure to upgrade their production capabilities. Further, it incurs greater burden on domestic consumers by raising domestic vehicle prices, yet creates less jobs than the Thai policy does. On the contrary, by staying out of production activities, the Thai state is able to draw the line between public and private interests. It encourages competition in the domestic market and was able to introduce liberalization to the industry earlier than the Malaysian state. The local producers, hence, are forced to improve their products in order to survive and the industry thereby experiences rapid expansion, contributing greatly to employment in the country.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic policy</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_93bc4c144cb8879ee82d5bb832315246" level="item"><did><unittitle>Failure at the Speed of Light: Project Escalation and De-Escalation in the Software Industry</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00118</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hickerson, Thomas B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c6d10b5651a061caf8bf076d92532019"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9d136bdf572dd669e455b7828dd44611"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This thesis is about failure -- more specifically, failure in the software industry. Failure is an attractive subject because everyone experiences it, allowing people to understand on a personal level what will work in business -- and what won't. Failure is also a concept that is difficult to define, as there are many different academic opinions on the subject. The aim of this thesis is to take a look at notable failures in the software sector, and draw lessons from them in the context of organizational failure, looking at the internal and external factors that caused the projects to fail. It will look at three cases where software projects failed. Two of the cases were very public, involving not only corporations but also governmental bodies, including the City of Denver's Computerized Baggage Handling System project and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Virtual Case File project. The third case deals with failure within a private company, the ArsDigita Corporation; while the company was still privately held, the information around the company's problems was made public by dissatisfied leaders and employees within the company. We shall look at the three cases through the framework of project escalation, which is defined as an escalating commitment to the project even after signs of failure are evident. We also discuss how each project de-escalated, and what kind of effect this had on the firms involved. In taking a look at each project, we will see that software had little or nothing to do with the failure at all. Instead, the internal and external factors surrounding each project contributed to its problems. Escalation and de-escalation are very important tools used to prove this, as they categorize the internal faults that each firm experienced while trying to execute their goals. However, external shocks to each project also played their part in the project failure. Following the three studies are short descriptions of systems that have been created in response to the problems project managers have encountered, showing us that companies realize that escalation is a problem, and they are proposing new strategies to identify and deal with it.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Finance</subject><subject source="local">Government business enterprises</subject><subject source="local">Information technology</subject><subject source="local">Internet (Computer network)</subject><subject source="local">Management</subject><subject source="local">Technology and State</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c2b658fe15c59a76f67dc74a95c8e43e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Misreading Moscow: Toward a New Interpretation of Russian Peacekeeping in the Early 1990s</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00119</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jeffers, Kristina N</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bb91d525af203e1315d62a9167ad3c42"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_77651e6a516c057d50dd3aca1f4d83a0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Since the early 1990s, the topic of Russian peacekeeping has received a certain amount of academic attention, much of it negative. Many of the criticisms that have been leveled against Russian peacekeeping have a basis in fact and will be addressed in this paper, but an analysis of the primary documents and the debate which went on in the Russian Federation during the mid-1990s reveals a much more complex picture than simply that of a post-imperial actor bent on regional hegemony. This paper places the Russian peacekeeping experience within general trends in UN peace support operations, evaluates the efficacy and shortcomings of Russian peacekeeping efforts and examines the factors which influenced Russian peacekeeping.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian intervention</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4ed7a57d145726c61b36904d1c572f55" level="item"><did><unittitle>Education in Complex Emergencies: A Case Study of the IRC Guinea Education Program</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00120</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jones, Deborah</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_df285ba0f5c93df0ed51e2e1e33e801f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_bb2d131833e2fa5aed9346d983e2983a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone sent tens of thousands of people across the border to safety in Guinea. The newly arrived refugees started schools on an ad hoc basis to protect their children. Intervention by the International Rescue Committee, an agency that has traditionally specialized in humanitarian relief, took on the mandate to organize the refugee schools into one system and to implement programs as part of the relief effort. The lives of the refugees were changed because the IRC sponsored education programs gave an entire generation of children, and tens of thousands of adults, access to a formal education, to non-formal programs and vocational training they otherwise would not have had. The programs made a difference because: Tens of thousands of children ages 5-17 were given the opportunity to attend formal school programs equal to the formal programs in their home countries. Non-formal education programs were relevant to the lives of the refugees. In many cases, it was the first time these beneficiaries had ever been exposed to the information they received regardless of the setting. Knowledge and skills gained by the children and adults have been verified via documents that certify learning, training or skills. Because the countries of origin recognize the documents, the refugees can continue schooling or access employment upon repatriation. The statistics, revealed for the first time, are dramatic. For example, the first IRC sponsored school year came to a close in July 1991. Data show reveal that 9 percent of the population of refugee students would could have attended school actually did attend IRC sponsored schools. A decade and a half later, when the school year came to a close in 2005, the percentage of the population of refugee students would could have attended school increased to 61 percent. This thesis is an analysis of how and why that change occured.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Education</subject><subject source="local">Forced migration</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian intervention</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0e5aac3f7253e073b24a6a01cd85c4b7" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Risk of Democracy: Theoretical and Empirical Considerations on the Effects of Electoral Uncertainty on Latin American Emerging Markets</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00121</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lopez-Aranda, Jaime G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5a195e26f09c6e6f814f96dbafbebc45"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_cee73cfd6dbaf5a57c94ebe6fd5199ab"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: I derive two basic models from political-business cycle (PBC) theory and the original obsolescing bargain model to assess the level of political and economic risk associated with Latin American elections. The first model posits that the economic risks associated with the victory of a given candidate are a function of both ideology and the macroeconomic outlook of the country. The second model builds on these assumptions to analyze the specific case of the risk of expropriation or measures tantamount to expropriation, as well as of other disruptive policies such as sudden tax hikes. It posits that this particular risk is a function of the ideological preferences of the government, as in the first case, but also of the economic cost associated with the policy. I contend that the models help explain past and recent instances of macroeconomic instability and expropriation events. I also argue that the PBC model explains why the lead of left-wing candidates in Mexico and Brazil has not resulted in an increased perception of risk for these countries as measured by sovereign spreads--in spite of the notion that these types of candidates are invariable associated with investor malaise. I also argue, however, that the models and the theories from which they are derived are best understood as frameworks for the analysis and that it is difficult to generalize the conclusions derived from any given case.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Privatization</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a08a47660654c6a616ce8548297b955e" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Invisible Enemy: Suicide Terrorism in Chechnya and Sri Lanka</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00122</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Manekas, Jillian P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_35291daa76b43ba2c3df84adb924b55f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_142b39d11be1cd8c07236677da490087"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Suicide terrorists strike without warning and are difficult if not impossible to stop. The use of suicide terrorism around the world continues to grow, as does its use against civilian populations. The study of a suicide terrorist is very difficult because they are almost always dead before any one has any knowledge of their intent. This form of violence is becoming ever more prevalent today in various conflicts around the world.  It is therefore paramount that a deeper understanding of suicide terrorism is understood in order to develop means with which to combat it. This paper discusses suicide terrorism theory and the importance of both the organizational and the individual motivations to use suicide terrorism as a weapon. Using a comparative case study of two conflicts that have used suicide bombers I will draw out similarities and contrasts to highlight what causes individuals and organizations to use this weapon. In reviewing the cases of Chechnya and Sri Lanka this paper will explore the history of each conflict, the ideology used by each organization to legitimize the use of suicide terrorism, the organizational structures of these terrorist organizations, individual motivations for individuals within these groups who volunteer for suicide missions, and review measures to counter suicide terrorism. The aim of this research is to explore suicide terrorism's use in two specific conflicts in order to gain an understanding of the motivations for its use and an increased awareness of the triggers that cause individuals to volunteer for these missions. These issues are essential for consideration in attempting to combat these attacks before they occur.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_227caba30d5c12a2080755eeabf49af3" level="item"><did><unittitle>World Bank-Financed Resettlement in China: The Influence of Property Rights in Resettlement Practices and Outcomes</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00123</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mclellan, Marta L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_47ae95c71a3ff1a77968e57ea3d6b4a1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_642c23817b5f86f963b027eaeb0f17e7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: Based primarily on 21 interviews of Ecuadorian immigrants carried out in New York City, this thesis presents findings that look at the tradeoffs migrants face when they send remittances. In addition, the data collected provides insights on the reasons behind their decisions and the broader implications of remittance sending for this particular immigrant group. This information is presented within the larger context of migration theory and explores the phenomenon of recent Ecuadorian migration. The study reveals the prevalence of remittance sending among Ecuadorian immigrants and the potential for sending collective remittances. The findings from the small study also point out areas for further research about this growing immigrant community in New York. With this in mind, a set of policy recommendations largely based on the participants' feedback are presented for the Ecuadorian government and civic groups to improve the level of organization and unity within the Ecuadorian community in New York City and facilitate the transfer of resources to their communities back home.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Community development</subject><subject source="local">Emigration and immigration</subject><subject source="local">Immigrants</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ff20ef1ac0fe3b9efa830fcbdf2e7dec" level="item"><did><unittitle>Democratic Islamists?

Abstract: This study seeks to contribute to a heightened understanding of Islamism as it relates to political parties functioning within democratic or democratizing countries. To begin, it will very briefly examine theoretical Islamist approaches to participation in democratic systems to establish that many Islamists do believe that Islam and democracy are compatible and that the participation of Islamist political parties in democratic systems is permissible and, indeed, desirable. With this basis established, the core contribution of this study follows with an in-depth analysis of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), its evolution, and its political agenda in the areas of Islamic law and governance, democracy and domestic politics, foreign policy and security, and economics. The experience of PAS, which has peacefully participated in Malaysia's quasi-democratic system since the period before independence from Britain in 1957, may challenge many of the assumptions commonly held about Islamist parties, while at the same time reinforcing others. It finds that PAS is a politically savvy actor that has demonstrated its adaptability to electoral conditions and challenges. Despite this adaptability, it is unlikely that the group -- even in the face of complete liberalization of the Malaysia political process -- will ever achieve national political power given Malaysia's demographics, cleavages within the Malay-Muslim community, and institutional challenges that favor the incumbents.  Yet, this assessment shows that presently PAS can be called a party of democratic Islamists and that its position as the most powerful opposition party in the country serves the cause of greater democratization within the Malaysian political system.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Civil Society</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a34341594034f69e9ff5e01eb6dee6fd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Development of Supporting Industries for Vietnam's Industrialization</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00126</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mori, Junichi</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8eb64c1e5fc0136fb288eab5d74d23d3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_49236a5c3aa4ec9733b4f79006cdc4a3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Vietnam opened up to the outside world in the early 1990s, and expected that the massive inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) would accelerate economic growth.  However, FDI inflow actually decreased after a small boom in the mid 1990s. While various external factors are responsible for this, internal factors have also affected the flow of FDI. In particular, the weakness of supporting industries is considered to be one of the primary factors responsible for this. Competitive supporting industries are required to attract more FDI into Vietnam, because multi-national corporations (MNCs) consider them to be an important factor in the decision to expand FDI, in addition to labor costs. Moreover, the development of supporting industries is necessary for amplifying FDI's positive externalities in Vietnam. Although many developing countries are trying to attract FDI in order to accelerate economic growth, the net externalities of FDI for host countries seem ambiguous.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject><subject source="local">Technology transfer</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a356beda2c58826be490b67f819707f2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Afghanistan, Education and the Formation of the Taliban</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00127</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nolan, Leigh E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4e06fcc7f0f67ab778b6f7672faaff78"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_07f9834d338038c3818d175bd1bbc54a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: In the past half-century alone, Afghanistan has seen the collapse of its monarchy, the installation of a Soviet secular state, a successful Mujahideen insurgency to overthrow the Communist government, debilitating factionalization of Mujahideen clans, the precipitous rise and collapse of the Taliban government, and the installation of Hamid Karzai's fledgling government in the wake of post 9/11 US intervention. Underlying these successive waves of conflict has been an ongoing struggle between secular and religious control of Afghanistan's educational institutions. Control of the education system has been a mobilizing force for the conservative Islamist movement, the socialists, the overthrow of the Soviet government and the subsequent rise to power of the Taliban. This thesis will examine both the symbolic and the substantive role that the education system in Afghanistan has had in precipitating these successive waves of conflict with a particular focus on the madrassa system and its impact on the emergence of the Taliban.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Education</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_97147cae0a7b8cda39d37edd7cec759f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Exporting Jihad: Iran's Use of Non-State Armed Groups</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00128</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">O'Brien, James M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_92034637d108e58df28ed46f6c3f4862"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7732d8c707eef8746599d8f76bd2f5a9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper examines Iran's use of non-state armed groups to achieve its political and security objectives. It recognizes the use of non-state armed groups as being a critical component to an Iranian security doctrine that is guided by strategic asymmetry. Specifically, it examines: the political and strategic cultures that contribute to the use of non-state armed groups; the structural components that facilitate their use; the operational particulars of the groups which Iran utilizes; the broader implications of their strategic employment. To achieve this qualitative study, this paper uses an architecture for the study of  non-state armed groups. This architecture was developed by Professors Richard Shultz, Douglas Farrah, and Itamara Lochard in the US Air Force INSS Occasional Paper (57), entitled Armed Groups: A Tier-One Security Policy. This framework provides four categories of non-state armed groups, and it utilizes six variables for the analysis of individual groups. Analysis leads this study to conclude the following: Iran's senior leadership sees the exportation of jihadi insurgencies as paramount to achieving its long-term ideological goals.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Comparative government</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Deterrence (Strategy)--History</subject><subject source="local">Immigrants</subject><subject source="local">Intelligence service</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Leadership</subject><subject source="local">Migration, Internal</subject><subject source="local">Military Art and Science</subject><subject source="local">Minorities</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Peace</subject><subject source="local">Regional planning</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Transnational crime</subject><subject source="local">War</subject><subject source="local">World politics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e33e72c793d9b5aef35d8e6fa4ff0efb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Beyond Preferential Market Access:  Enhancing the Development Potential of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), a Focus on the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas)</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00129</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ofori-Adjei, Akua  B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_de7eee8d025a8ec801c2ffb08bd262cb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_61c1e7e2cc4edb00fd1eee8bb97b52cf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Trade preferences targeted at developing countries have been a feature of developed countries' commercial policies for the past forty years. There are several debates on whether such preferential trade agreements yield benefits to participating countries. This paper, using the example of the fairly generous Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (over 98 percent of products from qualifying sub-Saharan countries to the US receive duty free treatment), examines some of the underlying reasons for the poor performance of preferential trade arrangements on the export performance of eligible countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Economic policy</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Investments, Foreign</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1673b9c24301aff78aa6aebbf60d9e0f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Under What Conditions Should Donors Promote Consulting Services in Developing Countries?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00130</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pleva, Paul M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_99af773f4d6cab0d0816a95f30f2f713"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_120c184d0ffdbf0dca1f94282cdfa902"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper examines how the provision of consulting services to businesses in developing countries can be improved by setting out a framework for assessing when it is well justified for donors to intervene in the consulting market. Much donor thinking on consulting services has focused on how to deliver the services effectively, but less thought has addressed the conditions for intervention. This paper attempts to fill that gap and offer direction for future research. The paper first describes the donor history of consulting services and tells a story of intervention evolving from direct provision to market intervention and most recently fragmenting along multiple theoretical faults. In response to the volatile conceptual history, the paper lays out a four part framework for assessing whether intervention is well justified under given circumstances. The first piece of the framework requires showing that the benefits of consulting services are greater than the costs in the society. Second, potential market failures are examined to help explain low levels of service provision in situations where benefits outweigh costs. Third, equity rationales for intervention are considered. Fourth, even when potential benefits and a demonstrated market failure exist, donors must have a cost effective method of intervention; the paper provides a description of how to determine if the intervention is cost effective. The framework offers intervention options corresponding to potential problems discovered in steps one and two of the framework. The paper reaches four conclusions. First, empirical research is required to determine (1) the degree to which business cash flows change due to consulting assistance, (2) the costs of consulting services, (3) the commonness or diversity of knowledge and advice demanded by businesses, and (4) the factors contributing to monopoly. Second, information failure deserves careful attention as a determinant of need for strategy consulting interventions. Third, promoting guarantee schemes is an under explored option. Finally, there may be many circumstances which don't call for intervention.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic assistance</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Economics.</subject><subject source="local">Public welfare</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_1215e45d8771560e79448b183888b0e1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Industrial Revolution:  International Outsourcing in Manufacturing</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00131</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Presnell, Benjamin</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_83e2635060cc08ac0b5d614d13a7c3db"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_1960919eeefe82ab5060d4f361d144ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: The purpose of this work is innovation and outsourcing; and the relationship of the two to firm success. Since companies of all types and sizes now use outsourcing to some degree, understanding the full impact of this activity on a firm's ability to innovate is crucial. This is especially important as outsourcing gets closer to the firm's value creating activities and core competencies. Some firms are already doing this successfully; others do not. Because the ceramic tableware industry is a highly competitive consumer goods segment that miraculously continues to survive import competition, this research will look under the plate and examine outsourced manufacturing in the industry. Cracks in the fine glaze of the industry in the western economies are obvious, but outsourcing has the potential to introduce new life into old favorites that have lined the cabinets and set the table for generations. How a firm decides to implement outsourcing dictate whether this proposition pays. Using case studies and a decision framework, the paper establishes an integrative way to evaluate offshore outsourcing. The decision framework, comprised of key economic and business strategy theories, dictates a decision to outsource when the firm is able to maximize its ability to internalize key aspects of the outsourcing. It also dictates a set of criteria from innovation theory that firms will seek the strongest appropriation models available when outsourcing in order to minimize the loss of innovation sources. Together, these are applied to the case study firms for analysis. The conclusion this paper draws is the need for businesses to understand fully the strategic value of outsourcing, but in the context of the individual firm. Unless the decision is fully vetted and part of a larger strategy for competitive advantage, moving production outside the firm just delays the inevitable.  Such a failure is avoidable.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Management</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_07375524b1c2518a580b36dacdb055f3" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Local as Client: Educational Decentralization and Partnership in Nicaragua</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00132</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Roland, Eric S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_31bf445452ac307e422c7b3b686ce4de"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b519b1e48bdafe52fe668c16881e17e3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: What has characterized the educational landscape of the developing world perhaps more poignantly than any other trend in recent history is a definitive march towards decentralized school management. A succession of events has unmistakably placed the power of decision-making in the hands of local and regional in-country authorities, replacing in irreversible fashion the bureaucratic and bloated management schemes of yesteryear. Developed and developing world governments have learned to incorporate such a trend into daily operations as they realize the veritable power of local actors to reform educational practice. The decentralization movement, spurred on by a variety of motivating factors, holds serious promise for education systems worldwide. The prospect of empowering schools and surrounding communities to serve as decision-makers and formulators of policy is a powerful one indeed. Nicaragua serves as the ideal nation upon which to focus an analysis of the decentralization movement. For decades, the state has struggled through perilous, centralized planning of its education sector. In recent years, though, the nation has witnessed a transformation of sorts with respect to educational management. School leaders and local citizens have been targeted as the heirs of the education policy domain. Initiatives aimed at decentralizing educational authority have introduced the possibility of a political power shift from the center to the periphery. Citizens find themselves in a greater position of authority, as school directors and local politicians are scrutinized by community members. Efficiency and accountability represent the desired hallmarks of modern day pedagogical practice. Implementing such change, though, has not been without its notable challenges. In the developing context, political instability represents an unfortunate reality. Sustainable educational policy becomes difficult to implement, as turnover in governmental administrations prevent long-term strategic approaches from coming to fruition. As well, nations such as Nicaragua struggle to provide the needed resources, financial and otherwise, to meet the demands of a decentralized management scheme. Local leadership capacity must be strengthened if citizen participation is to serve as the paradigm for the future.  A gap in the capacity to carry out decentralization reform has arisen across communities. With these pressing issues in mind, an innovative partnership is offered between local communities and the international organization. Although seemingly opposite with respect to political engagement, the two entities together offer much towards resolving the decentralization divide. Three viable avenues are suggested as a means of uniting the local and the global and improve educational practice both in Nicaragua and throughout the developing context. Global networks of viable information sharing ought to be in place. Local educational challenges need to be legitimized on the world stage. Fundamentally, though, local educational agents, their needs, and best practices must serve as the focus of any educational management reform. It is through the power of these communities, and the parallel support of international organizations, that the global decentralization campaign depends.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Community development</subject><subject source="local">Education</subject><subject source="local">Globalization</subject><subject source="local">Information technology</subject><subject source="local">International agencies</subject><subject source="local">International Relations</subject><subject source="local">Internet (Computer network)</subject><subject source="local">Non-governmental organizations</subject><subject source="local">Organizations</subject><subject source="local">Privatization</subject><subject source="local">Regional planning</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject><subject source="local">Technology and State</subject><subject source="local">Technology transfer</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_83ce43cd037f1271c76be61b42190d65" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Two Intifadas: An Analysis of the Strategies and Tactics of the Israelis and the Palestinians</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00133</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ron, Jonathan</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6f8a82f650b2ccac09975f58fb48bc44"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_d0eceb6a057dadff37c3f82819e47b75"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: This paper tests the hypothesis that when two countries participate in the same transnational ethnic or cultural network, the volume of trade between them increases.  Using the gravity model of international trade and data on the United States in 2000, we find that while older ancestral groups do not influence bilateral trade flows, a one-percentage increase in the foreign-born population increases bilateral trade by at least 9 percent. We also conclude that the linguistic composition of the country positively influences its trade flows. Finally, we apply these empirical findings to the current debate on U.S. immigration policy.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Ethnic relations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6c155aad8c0c9099b29921826a0b6b94" level="item"><did><unittitle>Free Trade and Weak States: The Case of Dr-Cafta in Nicaragua</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00135</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Runyon, Molly</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f5204cc44e8685688a0aecf4253576ed"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_d0ab28c10d0f9a4bae3bf4f188c56a36"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: Organizations have a crisis threshold that is a product of the adaptive capacity in their component organizations. This crisis threshold can be adjusted by implementing changes in organizational structure, organizational culture, and the processes that the organization uses. By implementing changes in these areas within component organizations, the overall adaptive capacity of the organization will be increased and its crisis threshold raised. Analysis and case studies are based on U.S. Marine Corps culture, organization, and processes along with case studies of combat operations in Iraq.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Leadership</subject><subject source="local">Management</subject><subject source="local">Military Art and Science</subject><subject source="local">National security</subject><subject source="local">Organizations</subject><subject source="local">Security, International</subject><subject source="local">War</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0312d673378f6df25c7e7d3a17123af5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Politics and Modern History of Hazara: Sectarian Politics in Afghanistan</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00137</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sarabi, Humayun</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d288efa3fb56b4dcf61504ed9f7f3d72"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a50ab08516ee4728d97dca06b8322bad"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

This study is also important in terms of how external forces and internal conflicts combined to have disastrous consequences for the Hazara community in Afghanistan as Humayun Sarabi demonstrates, the use of sectarian division between the small Shii community and the two larger ethnic groups--Tajik and Pashtun. To finally explain what happened, the writer analyzed original sources that demonstrate how the Human Rights violations that took in siege of Kabul and the civil war that followed the defeat of the PDPA and during the rise of Taliban.

Abstract: This paper examines human trafficking within the European Union and questions how to provide international protection to victims of human trafficking in the EU. The focus of this paper is on the situation of victims who face deportation from the European Union: non-EU citizens who are trafficked into the EU. The core of this thesis is the research question: what mechanisms can be developed within, or to complement, the common European asylum system to provide assistance and protection to victims of human trafficking who want assistance but face deportation from the EU? The argument is maintained that victims of human trafficking are in need of international protection and must not be deported nor forced to return to their country of origin.  First, the thesis examines the possibility of affording victims of human trafficking in the EU the right to asylum under the common European asylum system.

More than a year after the signing of the so-called Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), about three years ahead of the first post-conflict elections, and with the crucial referendum over the independence of the South in 2011, making unity attractive is a last attempt to avoid the fragmentation of Africa's largest country. While the stated task requires action on many levels, this thesis addresses two macro-level issues that can potentially have a large impact on the attractiveness of unity: the state- and power structures in the future Sudan and, as part of this broad picture, the electoral system by which the representatives are to be elected. First, given that the past 50 years have brought the Sudan to the brink of disintegration, it is argued that the constitutional obligation for a comprehensive constitutional review should be used to radically rethink the state- and power structure in the Sudan, in order to build a new Sudan on fresh foundations. The framework presented in this thesis as an example of such a radical restructuring suggests the creation of large, clearly heterogeneous federal entities with an internal power balance between the communities that are on different sides of the deepest Sudanese divides. This is intended to reduce the interests in some of the most contentious issues at this point -- as for example the exact delineation of the border between the North and the South -- problems which continue to fuel tensions rather than making unity attractive. Such states, vested with significant autonomous powers, will also be well situated to counter the historical dominance of the center, which marginalized many communities and has rendered unity an unattractive option for them. Yet, the unwillingness to engage in such a discussion by leading Sudanese is discussed, and some proposals for more modest adaptations of the current system are proposed. Second, the 2009 Sudanese elections represent a major event in creating and assessing the attractiveness of unity. They therefore need careful preparation, which should include a thorough consideration of different electoral systems that could help to promote peace and unity. As a contribution to this discussion, this thesis suggests an adapted proportional electoral system for the legislative elections, which can provide an incentive for integrative behavior through the distribution of bonus seats to parties with a nationwide outreach. Unfortunately, the interim constitution has pre-determined that the new president shall be elected in a two-round majoritarian system, before an integrative discussion on this topic has been held. In light of this, the adoption of a strong code of conduct among the competing parties for the presidency could be used as a flexible tool to commit the candidates to run on a national platform and on an integrative message. Together, it is argued, the proportional and the majoritarian aspects with an integrative spin in the two elections could help to make unity attractive. Mindful that the decisions on these matters will finally have to be taken by the Sudanese politicians, and that the process of decision-making will crucially impact the legitimacy of the adopted solution, it is hoped that this academic contribution can help foster discussion on these topics in the Sudan.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Conflict Management</subject><subject source="local">Ethnic relations</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">Law reform</subject><subject source="local">Minorities</subject><subject source="local">Peace</subject><subject source="local">Political rights</subject><subject source="local">Reconciliation</subject><subject source="local">War</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9d8055a86b0e4dda53239b9b01cec6c5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Success Factors of Agricultural Futures Markets in Developing Countries and Their Implication on Existing and New Local Exchanges in Developing Countries</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00140</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shim, Euna</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_10a5b1c1fe43400e5f8fd6163934cb3a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_0389f90dd92af7bc9dca8c3f3b10726b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Developing countries market participants most often have relied on futures trading at international exchanges in developed countries to hedge out price risks rising in local markets. Nonetheless, in recent years of futures markets development, a few developing countries succeeded in launching a local exchange and contract competing against the highly liquid international exchanges. This paper addresses the success in these developing countries and provides a through analysis of what may have been important in generating such notable outcomes. A number of hypotheses have been tested in a qualitative sense and i) presence of large physical markets, ii) a contract that is substantially different from existing contracts or with a large basis risk, iii) development of financial intermediaries and iv) development of institutional arrangement including financial markets, regulations were largely factors of success followed by presence of committed market actors, low level of industry integration and export orientation of underlying products.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic policy</subject><subject source="local">Economics.</subject><subject source="local">Finance</subject><subject source="local">International finance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e515bab126c8f1ccb54a61661f9e59d6" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Changing Face of Microfinance in India: The Costs and Benefits of Transforming from an NGO to a Non-Bank Financial Company</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00141</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, Raven R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ea669c523a63225393bf9f0598f95c0c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4d5482fe3b8a4ad1a5ab9b81820ab7ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: It has been approximately 25 years since the birth of Microfinance with the Founding of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh by Professor Mohammad Yunus. The field has since spread with the adaptation and evolution of Professor Yunus' ideas to various countries and contexts. However, with all the excitement about the prospects of the field to contribute to poverty alleviation and the integration of the world's poor into the rapidly evolving global market system, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP) estimates that microfinance probably reaches fewer than 5 percent of its potential clients. Although this is a very rough estimate of those not reached by formal financial institutions, it might serve to provide a general idea of what share of the potential clients of microfinance have yet to be reached. India is home to a growing and innovative sector of microfinance. With a large portion of the world's poor, India is likely to have a large potential demand for microfinance. For this reason, It makes sense to consider the changing face of microfinance in India, in order to shed light on comparable changes in the field all over the world. The overarching question this study looks to answer in the interests of greater impact and outreach of microfinance in India is: What are the costs and benefits of a Microfinance NGO of transforming to a Non-Bank Financial Company (NBFC)? More specifically, how does organizational form affect a Microfinance Institution's ability to achieve success by both financial and social standards? By taking a closer look at three cases of transformation to or start up as an NBFC, we can better understand the intricacies, challenges, successes, and opportunities for microfinance delivery of independent MFIs in India.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_240b057d42e47f8957ad2ab7f531e7cd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Hedge Fund Portfolio Construction</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00142</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Soerensen, Jan T.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8425efa984bbb27ed05cbecde8832b95"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4954c6d52ea14953e9f7eac7d1af0ffa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Investing in hedge funds requires a diversified and well-constructed portfolio of different hedge fund strategies to ensure that risks at both the individual fund manager level and the systemic level are minimized. The different hedge fund strategies are exposed to different systemic risks, and returns will therefore change with changes in the market environment. These different risk/return profiles provide almost endless possibilities for creating value through active portfolio allocation, where strategies interplay to generate consistent absolute returns.  A prerequisite for a successful allocation is a thorough understanding of the different risk/return drivers in each strategy. Risk in hedge funds comes primarily through exposure to the different underlying security instruments which the funds use to generate returns. A number of hedge fund strategies invest in more than one asset class, thereby diversifying the return generation, but not necessarily reducing the total risk exposure. An explanation for the risk in some of the hedge fund strategies can be found through regression analysis against other market indicators, while some strategies can only partly be explained by regression analysis. This lack of clearly defined market risk does not indicate that the strategy is risk-free, but merely that the associated risks are non-quantifiable, due to the use of non-linear return methods such as derivatives and leverage. The optimal portfolio allocation will always be a trade-off among the risks an investor is willing to incur for an anticipated return level. Risks can be measured both as standard deviation and as Value-at-Risk, but a hedge fund portfolio should be constructed with the mean-variance optimization model, as none of the hedge fund strategies can be rejected for normality if the return distribution is considered according to time relevance. The separation of the hedge fund portfolio into a core and a tactical part would be useful for sophisticated hedge fund investors who have the ability to actively follow market environments, and monitor the risk/return parameters continuously. For the less sophisticated investor, the hedge fund portfolio should be kept at a core level with a long-term investment objective. Due to opaque investment methods, hedge fund investing requires specialized skills, such as an understanding of complex security instruments, extensive industry knowledge, and analytical ability. An institution or high net worth individual may benefit from an intermediary partner e.g. a fund of hedge funds who possesses the necessary qualifications and skills to filter through the many thousands of hedge funds and understands how the different hedge fund strategies can be optimally combined to generate consistent absolute returns.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Business</subject><subject source="local">Finance</subject><subject source="local">International finance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2ad591ef58b7adc4b33a1329105f1ba6" level="item"><did><unittitle>Coping with Displacement: The Case of Internally Displaced Persons in Jinja, Uganda</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00143</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sohne, Sandra I.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_41c3eeb71b442b30f8ded9dfa6f383bc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5bddaf82abae27a27a7e803a995997f8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Even though Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are among the most vulnerable victims of conflict, and constitute arguably the largest at-risk population in the world, the Global IDP Project has noted that research on the numbers and needs of this population is limited. In many war-affected countries, IDPs are reduced to the role of silent victims, as they have little opportunity to simply voice their concerns to the authorities. As such, understanding the strategies IDPs have developed to voice their concerns to authorities and integrate into urban communities will allow for a broader understanding of IDP experiences and coping strategies.  Drawing on field research conducted in June and July of 2005 in Uganda, the country with the third largest displaced population, this thesis explores how belonging to a social network, neighborhood association, or group enhances the experiences of Acholi IDPs in Jinja, the second-largest city in Uganda. This research explores the hypothesis that IDPs who work in groups and align with internal and external networks, are better able to cope with displacement than IDPs who work alone to pursue individual livelihoods. Those who work in groups and align themselves with networks find employment and gain protection from threats more easily than those working alone. Networks also give members access to assets, services, livelihoods, shelter, and education and promote positive mental health and well-being. Membership in a network or alignment with an association also promotes peaceful co-existence with the indigenous population. Hence, IDPs who align themselves with networks are more successful at integrating into their urban communities than those who work alone. Using the case study of Jinja, Uganda, this research will contribute to our understanding of how urban IDPs respond to crises. This research explores the difference between how IDPs and indigenous populations in urban areas experience poverty. It explores individual agency in making decisions about whether to flee, where to flee to, and how to recreate important social, economic, and cultural aspects of their lives. This research looks at the patterns of displacement to urban areas and the ways in which IDPs access resources through social networks.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Forced migration</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5db5fd210657a1a0050d04ccbb678fdb" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Potential for Wind-Powered Desalination in Water-Scarce Countries</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00144</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Spang, Edward</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_73cd0263d15f894d13d5b6bdffbf57df"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7caa3dada94621a8b830f4539fbbc11e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: This paper explores the global potential for integrating wind power and desalination technologies to increase water supplies. Desalination processes allow for the conversion of abundant salt water to relatively scarce freshwater and therefore represent great potential for water scarcity alleviation. A major limitation of desalination is its high energy requirements, and therefore it is useful to explore how renewable energy sources (such as wind) can be linked into desalination systems for sustainable freshwater production into the future. Desalination and wind technologies are summarized in this paper, including growth trends, costs, and emerging technological advancements. GIS is then used to generate a map of global wind-powered desalination potential hotspots, to give a rough idea where the integration of these technologies might be the most applicable. The analysis generated a short list of countries that have the greatest potential for leveraging gains from wind-powered desalination plants, including: Barbados, Cape Verde, Egypt, Haiti, Libya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Yemen. While there are significant limitations to the data used for this paper, it is hoped that the results of this analysis will generate discussions and further research on the implementation of wind-powered desalination in the identified countries, as well as other regions of the globe.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Economics.</subject><subject source="local">Energy policy</subject><subject source="local">Environmental Policy</subject><subject source="local">Natural resources</subject><subject source="local">Poverty</subject><subject source="local">Regional planning</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject><subject source="local">Technology transfer</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_cd9cf0ec6d62a641fa8ece7496b452dd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Conflict Sensitive Development--Reality or Wishful Thinking?</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00145</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pevzner, Marina</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cff408344c51a84b014eb55dee782759"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5212fd1489c46b30ac4b7aaf084220bc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: There has been a growing understanding among development NGOs and practitioners in both conflict resolution and development fields of the need to incorporate interdisciplinary approach to their practices. The rational behind this is to increase the effectiveness and sustainability of development projects and reduce the negative effects of development aid on ongoing conflicts. However, in reality many development agencies working in the context of conflict do not incorporate conflict sensitive planning of their projects. In this thesis I try to understand what makes the seemingly natural and much needed link between the development and conflict resolution fields so difficult to implement on the ground. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first chapter provides a basic theoretical framework of reference for the rest of the chapters. In this chapter, I give a basic (but not a complete) overview of the major historical trends in development and conflict resolution theory and practice, and the few examples of how the two are linked. The second chapter uses Georgia as a case study to understand the gaps according to development practitioners in being able to incorporate conflict sensitive work. The third chapter tries to understand these gaps through structural analysis of the differences between the two fields focusing on ethics and culture, values and needs, institutional incentives, accountability mechanisms, and capacities for organizational learning.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Community development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d29086e9c0e7d193537b66220c41e2c6" level="item"><did><unittitle>Macroeconomic Policy Framework for Reducing Deforestation: A Sri Lankan Case Study</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00146</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">White, Robin G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1de2f006783f1560a32631cffed7253d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_71148a2801124b455e51b0615a1b156d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Using a case study on Sri Lanka and comparing findings to literature on Bolivia and Cameroon, this thesis explores the linkages between economy-wide policies (both macroeconomic and sectoral policies) and deforestation in order to determine the macroeconomic policy framework conducive to limiting deforestation. For Sri Lanka, the case study explores the impact of agriculture subsidies, trade and government-sponsored irrigation schemes on deforestation arising from chena (slash-and-burn agriculture), rice cultivation, illicit felling, smallholder tea, cardamom cultivation and prawn farming. Agricultural subsidies have had little impact on forest loss because access to subsidies has been restricted or because labor or land constraints have prevented expansion of farms. Trade protection appears to have favored deforestation through increased cultivation of chena crops in particular regions, depending on the availability of alternative lifestyles. Domestic plantation supplies of timber, logging bans and monitoring of transported wood have discouraged illicit felling. Tea export duties have not directly impacted deforestation from tea smallholders. Corruption has played a key role in facilitating the clearing of mangroves for prawn-farming. Explicit government promotion of irrigation schemes has been the main government policy directly linked to deforestation. However, by enabling more intensive land-use, irrigation may have reduced future deforestation from chena in light of increasing population pressures and growing demand for agricultural land. The primary macroeconomic policy driver for deforestation in Bolivia has been government-sponsored settlement schemes for soybean cultivation. Long-term deforestation pressures remain high due to the unsustainability of soybean cultivation and the government's failure to take concrete measures to alleviate rural poverty. A lack of environmental planning and private market restrictions have also led to deforestation loss from logging. In Cameroon, deforestation has been driven by the introduction and sudden removal of coffee and cocoa subsidies, which have led to the expansion of coffee and cocoa plantations or abandonment of plantations in favor of increased slash-and-burn agriculture. Lack of fiscal restraint and insufficient policies promoting economic diversification created conditions that necessitated abrupt removal of agricultural subsidies and liberalization of coffee and cocoa marketing. A comparison of the findings from Sri Lanka, Bolivia and Cameroon demonstrates that a macroeconomic policy framework amenable to forest conservation needs to include explicit incorporation of environmental considerations in government-wide policy-making, be based on the long term, be focused on small-scale development targeted at disadvantaged groups, account for differing temporal and regional considerations, involve diversification, include private market restrictions and be supported by environmentally-friendly economic interventions by the international community.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Agriculture</subject><subject source="local">Development Economics</subject><subject source="local">Economic Development</subject><subject source="local">Economic policy</subject><subject source="local">Environmental Policy</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Land use</subject><subject source="local">Sustainable Development</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_89c38cb33b49b2a4d5de2943b4a7a585" level="item"><did><unittitle>Myth of Equality</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00147</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wigneswaran, Nirmalaguhan</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7b36c04c8cf24a666ce1caa3392b1888"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6493a5efd741fdd3dc96b4caf7fbe50b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract: Equality is a means not an end. It serves many purposes and is often a very efficient one. However, depending on the ends preferred, more efficient means may replace equality as the means to achieve such ends. In so far as different means may achieve preferred outcomes better, such means may replace equality in the context of achieving such preferred outcomes. A priori it could be concluded that a modern day system of innumerable social interactions and consequently innumerable rules, which is outcome oriented, would have a complex web of norms, the interplay of which would determine the extent to which the principle of equality could be employed.  An analysis of selected judicial dicta in the realms of international trade law and human rights law in the area of equality or its counterpart non-discrimination, across jurisdictions, both domestic and international, substantiates this claim. The analysis includes a study of WTO, ECJ, US and ECHR decisions. An approach that abandons the ideal of equality and recognizes the aims and effects approach, which in practice is employed, would be less disingenuous and more explanatory of the diverse decisions in this regard.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Commercial law</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">International law</subject><subject source="local">International Trade</subject><subject source="local">Political science</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0091af3f6c9c8404588361291a0ffe8b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Agriculture and Conflict: A Conceptual Framework for Development</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00148</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Zaur, Ian M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d84424a969ef2b83bc743118ef2ef501"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_59a559560e1a6a3ef34b7e3776240b2e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Abstract: When human governing systems are compared to those of the natural world, the natural world appears very stable by comparison. The rise and fall of civilizations, empires and states is at the same time accompanied by unmovable forests, oceans and rivers in which vast numbers of living things interact and maintain themselves without any guidance or direction from a central authority. When looked at closely, natural systems are in fact very complex entities with many different species interacting that are constantly changing and adapting, but somehow, the system as a whole remains stable. What is it about the dynamics of nature that allows it to look like a static governing system while human dynamics produce unstable governing systems? Is there some natural characteristic that results in natures stable systems that can be replicated to better create more stable human governing systems? This paper proposes the idea that, like natural systems, human governance systems can be defined as Complex Adaptive Systems, and that the key feature distinguishing human rule making from nature is legitimacy. Legitimacy itself will be shown as an emergent property of the human governance system and it is generated through the physical interaction of people in geographic space.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">MALD thesis</subject><subject source="local">Political Systems and Theories</subject><subject source="local">Legitimacy of governments</subject><subject source="local">Complex adaptive systems</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4f2adad4e7808230bcafdd2d79b939ac" level="item"><did><unittitle>'History Obliges' The Real Motivations Behind German Aid Flows in the Case of Namibia</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00150</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Schuring, Esther</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004" type="inclusive">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_83d691faadca15e82b97c4a03b565125"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b5e8275ec4dce49ef106792755c27ff2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Abstract:  This study explains the exceptional donor position that Germany assumes in Namibia. Contrary to the predominant discourse on aid allocation literature, this study finds that classic motives such as need, economic potential, strategic interest in military terms, democracy and region do not factor in as strongly in Namibia's case. Germany's aid flows are largely a result of two variables, (1) moral obligation, a largely understudied variable and (2) cultural similarity, a variable not often applied in the German context due to the removed colonial presence. Moral obligation is mainly a product of German-Namibian colonial history -the 'genocide' that the emperor's troops executed in 1904-07,  reinforced by the largely contested German aid flows to Namibia during South African occupation. The recognition of colonial wrongdoings by German politicians, coupled with external pressure have turned moral obligation into the most decisive variable in the German-Namibian aid relationship. Whereas internal pressure has been almost non-existent, external pressure has been exerted continuously and successfully by the Namibian government and by the Herero. Worried about its reputation and costly reparations, the German government appears to have used its generous aid flows in an attempt to silence these pressure sources. The second most influential variable, the cultural similarity to the 20,000 Namibia Germans, has political as well as sentimental roots: German politicians have cared and continue to do so for their constituency in Namibia and in no other country, the German language and traditions play such a significant role as in Namibia. Next to these two prevalent variables, a third variable has increasingly gained more momentum. Although not one of the predominant determinants of German aid flows, the socio-political strategic interest of the German government to placate potential tensions arising from the land reform issue has guaranteed that aid continues to flow. This variable is a combination of moral obligation (land reform as colonial legacy) and cultural similarity (concern about the well-being of the Namibia Germans).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_39c9d8a6e411483bb22061ff57ef6f6d" level="item"><did><unittitle>'Fine-Tuning the Marine Corps' Counterinsurgency Capabilities</unittitle><unitid>UA015.012.DO.00151</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ruvalcaba, Jaime</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004/2004" type="inclusive">2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e4c6c8fd1b63b55f8f24ae6f3208d648"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_fd1523116a0a54610f64f9fee91f1756"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
