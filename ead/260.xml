Field research in Ethiopia, Darfur, Uganda, the Balkans, West Africa, and Afghanistan has resulted in the publication of a number of major reports which have been received with considerable interest by the humanitarian community. In addition, the Center has played a leading role in informing the peace and justice process in Northern Uganda. Center-led contributions to the British Medical Journal and other media have helped shape the policy debate around the international response to the tragic December 26th tsunami in the Indian Ocean.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6d8c47028250240dce49ca13f154d262" level="item"><did><unittitle>Annual Report</unittitle><unitid>UA197.003.003.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2005/2006" type="inclusive">2005 -- 2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_392d78d2fabc9d318eff8abf71d9be3c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ea933000b01c399e631afcead86ec48a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Strategic planning undertaken in 2004/5 has paid off.

However, the overall shape of our deliverables in the coming twelve months will differ substantially from those of the closing year. 2006 was about building the Center; 2007 is about putting it the change processes into action. The vast majority of our 2007 deliverables focus on research and education. Our change process is captured in seven key processes, as described in detail in our three year strategy. Under each of these processes we list here the milestones, outputs and impact we hope to realize in 2007.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fd11ae1c9e4849b4e275d1866680b9a9" level="item"><did><unittitle>Annual Report</unittitle><unitid>UA197.003.003.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2007" type="inclusive">2006 -- 2007</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b346de3d6825c8f5a33e308a085abce2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_dc07f49c420f654d11a8496fff07dc83"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The year 2006/7 has been one of consolidation for the Feinstein International Center after major changes were implemented in the preceding year. We hired new faculty and staff, reinforced existing research, and enhanced our teaching agenda. We attracted new funders to the Center and are playing a larger role in the academic life of Tufts University. Our research in Sudan and Uganda has expanded. Recruitment to our faculty of Dr. Andrew Wilder, formally director of the Afghan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU), paves the way for further expanding the geographical scope of the Center's research in South and Central Asia. Our partnerships with African universities and research groups continue, as do those with western aid agencies. We have started a new partnership with Transparency International on a research program into the prevalence and effects of corruption in the humanitarian aid business. Throughout the year, Center faculty have been sought out by UN agencies,
        NGOs, and government aid departments to facilitate, chair, and advise upon the changing nature of humanitarian threats and response. In our educational agenda we continue to offer our Masters of Arts in Humanitarian Assistance degree and contribute to teaching in the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy as well as the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Our joint Humanitarian Studies initiative with Harvard and MIT has undergone a major upgrade and the number of Ph.D. students supported by Center faculty continues to increase. Looking forward to 2007/8, we envisage the start of major long-term research initiatives examining the effects of repeated crises on vulnerable communities, the opportunities being offered by the spread of cell phone technology in Africa, and the increasingly complex relationship between security, economics, and humanitarian need across the world.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a1bb3948e620c25d3dc62dfecbbc4751" level="item"><did><unittitle>Annual Report</unittitle><unitid>UA197.003.003.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2008/2009" type="inclusive">2008 -- 2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ef90e67e498a908fe8d57ac524d857ea"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c1f0ec07e655b5d0b9961d4be8d7e533"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We are pleased to publish our annual report for 2008/09.

Since the beginning of 2006, an interdisciplinary team has been working on a wide-ranging evidence-based research project that identifies the key issues that are likely to impact on humanitarian action in the coming decade, along with the practical implications of these issues for agency programming. During the first phase of the project, which ended in August 2006, the team researched four interrelated issues: the universality of humanitarianism, the implications of terrorism and counter-terrorism for humanitarian action, the search for coherence between humanitarian and political agendas, and the security of humanitarian personnel and the beneficiaries of humanitarian action. Six case studies have been conducted and a preliminary report, Humanitarian Agenda 2015: Principles, Power and Perceptions, was published in September 2006.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">War on Terrorism, 2001-</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarianism</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><corpname source="local">United Nations</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7d7d780d08549c6ddc60bf955f5e9096" level="item"><did><unittitle>Humanitarian Agenda 2015: Afghanistan Country Study</unittitle><unitid>UA197.001.DO.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Donini, Antonio</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c473d3f113cf001345e844015b991a5c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_fa151792483a5966d1c5f6a4588a986a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Paper dated June, 2006. This study is part of a research program undertaken by the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University on The Humanitarian Agenda 2015: Principles, Politics and Perceptions (HA 2015).1 The key findings of the research in Afghanistan are presented in the following pages under the four HA 2015 headings: the universality of the humanitarian enterprise; terror and counter-terror and its impact on humanitarian action; coherence of political and humanitarian endeavors; and issues related to security of communities and humanitarian personnel. This is preceded by a brief historical background and by an overview of Afghans perceptions of the aid effort. A final section presents key conclusions and (policy) recommendations. The four themes of the HA 2015 research come together in Afghanistan with clear-cut relevance. The externality of the aid enterprise and the baggage that comes with itvalues, lifestyle, attitude, and behavior of aid
        workerschallenge the purported universality of humanitarian action. The context of terrorism and counter-terrorism is at the heart of the international communitys involvement in Afghanistan: the initial objective of the US-led coalition was to smash Al Qaeda and the Taliban, not to engage in nation-building. The coherence agenda, exemplified both by the integration of humanitarian and human rights concerns within the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and by the pressures on NGOs to be part of the Coalitions combat team, colors the operating environment of the aid community. And the heavy toll inflicted by insurgents and criminal elements on the security of aid workers, both Afghan and international, cuts across the three other themes and deeply affects staff morale and ability to address critical humanitarian need.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">War on Terrorism, 2001-</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarianism</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><corpname source="local">Qaida (Organization)</corpname><corpname source="local">Taliban</corpname><corpname source="local">United Nations</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_13b56c4bdfe6c92145585b4d752b6392" level="item"><did><unittitle>Humanitarian Agenda 2015: Burundi and Liberia Country Studies</unittitle><unitid>UA197.001.DO.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Zeebroek, Xavier</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_80d4fb43edd9ddacdd0907ddc78cf53b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3474e0b778f6204e58b360701845fcde"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Paper dated July, 2006. Burundi: Within the four topics addressed by the Humanitarian Agenda 2015 research, three seem pertinent in the case of Burundicoherence, security and, to a lesser extent, terrorism. Many comparisons can be made with Liberia, in terms of the length and cruelty of the war and the type of involvement of the international community. The integrated structure of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) strongly influenced the design of the UN mission in Burundi (ONUB), even if the role and functions of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) were eventually different. Parallels with Afghanistan and Sudan are also relevant regarding the integrated character of the missions and issues of security. Liberia: Within the four topics addressed by the Humanitarian Agenda 2015 report, only two seem pertinent in the case of Liberiacoherence and security. The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has become a model for the
        fully-integrated mission, and is likely to be followed by other UN missions in Africa, such as Burundi or Sudan. Parallels with Afghanistan can also be made regarding the absorption of OCHA within the integrated mission.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">War on Terrorism, 2001-</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarianism</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><corpname source="local">Qaida (Organization)</corpname><corpname source="local">African Union</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_b67941e4551f3e4bdf2d22ca02ec08c2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Humanitarian Agenda 2015: Colombia Country Study</unittitle><unitid>UA197.001.DO.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Minear, Larry</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e0c0c59bbce905cb3f1bc55383a78bec"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_de11f76f6099bd258fe8d66e382da916"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Paper dated July, 2006. This case study on Colombia was undertaken as part of a larger research initiative, The Humanitarian Agenda 2015: Principles, Power, and Perceptions (HA 2015), which seeks to analyze the major challenges facing the humanitarian enterprise during the coming decade. The experience of Columbia sheds light on all four themes of the HA 2015 research. First, with respect to universality, Colombia sees itself as part and parcel of the western world. There is broad resonance between Colombian religious and civil traditions and the global humanitarian ethos, laws, and institutions. Second, he focus group and individual interviews conducted for this study concentrated on terrorism, understood as violence or the threat of violence against ordinary civilians, against their life, their property, their well-being. [Terrorism] is a means to attain a political goal which allegedly could not be attained by ordinary, lawful means, within the context of the
        established constitutional order.5 A broadly held consensus emerged that what might be called small t terrorism was tearing apart the human, social, economic, and political fabric of Colombian society while introducing major complications into the functioning of international and domestic humanitarian and human rights organizations. At the same time, alleged connections to an overarching global war on terrorism (capital T terrorism) were found to be overdrawn. As for the third theme, coherence, the prevailing political framework promoted by the United States government in the form of Plan Colombia and embraced by the Colombian authorities in its own democratic security policy provides an uneasy fit for international assistance and protection activities and a point of tension between the US and other donors. Finally, with regard to security, there has been by most accounts an overall reduction in the incidence of specific forms of violence in late 2005 and early 2006 from the
        withering levels of the preceding five years. Yet a climate of fear still pervades many sectors of society and there were, at the time of the research visit, still numerous incidents taking place, including killings and harassment of leaders of civil society organizations.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">War on Terrorism, 2001-</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarianism</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><corpname source="local">United Nations</corpname><corpname source="local">Eje'rcito de Liberacio'n Nacional (Colombia)</corpname><corpname source="local">Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4f358145962f71dcf28a83e36ebf7d47" level="item"><did><unittitle>Humanitarian Agenda 2015: Northern Uganda Country Study</unittitle><unitid>UA197.001.DO.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stites, Elizabeth</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cbf3d5aae298d81dd717d2bf2e4a3cd3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_30bb7067463100a8818eafa037c55647"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Paper dated June, 2006.

As a result of the various conflicts, the political and economic situation in different parts of Sudan is very different. North Sudan is largely peaceful with a stable, well-established government rich from oil revenues, though unemployment is a major problem (people complain that it is very difficult to get jobs without the right government connections. As a result, young men are going to the Middle East or Europe in search of work). The conflict began because Darfur felt neglected by the authorities in Khartoum and excluded from the peace talks between North and South Sudan, but it is exacerbated by tribal conflict which began in the 1980s. With the signing of the CPA, South Sudan is heading towards sustainable peace, and people displaced by the war are returning gradually. Under the terms of the CPA, there is a unified3 UN mission to monitor its implementation in the South (though the Mission HQ is in Khartoum). However, since South Sudan
        had no government institutions for over 20 years, the fledgling Government of South Sudan (GoSS) is struggling to establish itself. There is almost no infrastructure either. Juba, the capital, has few whole buildings and had lost electricity at the time of the study due to the breakdown of generators supplying the town. Interviewees highlighted housing, sanitation, and jobs as their most pressing problems. The conflict in Darfur has raged for three years, resulting in 300,000 deaths and the displacement of over two million people.4 Most of the displaced have been living in IDP camps, though some have tried to find shelter in large towns or with relatives. Understandably, interviewees in the camps complained of a lack of employment, food, shelter, education, water, etc. The shortage of food was one of the greatest problems and this has undoubtedly been exacerbated since the World Food Programme had to halve rations from May 2006 due to a lack of contributions from donors.
        However, in some of the IDP camps, interviewees were also concerned about the lack of money and opportunities for young adults to get married or continue with a university education (most education services in the camps are up to primary or secondary school level only). The conflict began because Darfur felt neglected by the authorities in Khartoum and excluded from the peace talks between North and South Sudan, but it is exacerbated by tribal conflict which began in the 1980s.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">War on Terrorism, 2001-</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarianism</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><corpname source="local">United Nations Mission in Sudan</corpname><corpname source="local">African Mission in Sudan</corpname><corpname source="local">African Union</corpname><corpname source="local">United Nations</corpname><corpname source="local">Qaida (Organization)</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ffdb7de8b595970574d5dc4aa6985e5f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Taking Sides or Saving Lives: Existential Choices for the Humanitarian Enterprise in Iraq: Humanitarian Agenda 2015: Iraq Country Study</unittitle><unitid>UA197.001.DO.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hansen, Greg</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fc8f06816e99f26c4865a6fe0853f22e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_97770d771a7eef490f7920a6f84b7d04"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Paper dated June, 2007. Iraq places the frailties and fault-lines of the humanitarian enterprise in stark relief. Perhaps more than any other highly politicized context, Iraq has fuelled a defensiveness and sense of existential threat among many in the humanitarian profession. And yet, while Iraqis have paid long and dearly for the flaws in the international humanitarian apparatus, evidence from ground-level suggests that pronouncements of the demise of principled humanitarian action are premature. Iraq may provide the strongest affirmation yet of the endurance of the Dunantist ethos and of the principled practice of humanitarianism.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">War on Terrorism, 2001-</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarianism</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">Iraq War, 2003-</subject><corpname source="local">Coalition Provisional Authority</corpname><corpname source="local">International Committee of the Red Cross</corpname><corpname source="local">International Federation of Red Cross &amp; Red Crescent Societies</corpname><corpname source="local">Multi-National Force-Iraq</corpname><corpname source="local">United Nations</corpname><corpname source="local">UN.

Following a series of observations about how humanitarianism is currently perceived in Iraq, this report highlights findings regarding the operational environment, donor environment, and strategic policy environment. The interviews conducted comprise a valuable compilation of field-based evidence, provided at a time of mounting access difficulties and diminishing awareness of the situation on the ground. In addition to extensive interviews, the report draws heavily upon work conducted in the region and the regular monitoring of developments by the
        Humanitarianism and War Project in 2004 and 2005, thus spanning a three-year period.2 It concludes with 20 recommendations for the UN system, Red Cross / Red Crescent Movement, humanitarian NGOs, the NGOs Coordinating Committee in Iraq (NCCI) and donors.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">War on Terrorism, 2001-</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarianism</subject><subject source="local">Terrorism</subject><subject source="local">Human rights</subject><subject source="local">Iraq War, 2003-</subject><corpname source="local">United Nations</corpname><corpname source="local">UN Assistance Mission for Iraq</corpname><corpname source="local">UN.

The paper highlights critical issues affecting the provision of humanitarian action and suggests how they could, partially at least, be redressed. Building on data collected through interviews in the aid community as well as with ordinary Afghans, the briefing paper finds that humanitarianism is under deep threat in Afghanistan because of the perceived association of aid agencies with the US-led intervention. Humanitarian actors and the principles they profess are under attack. The ability of humanitarian agencies to address urgent need is compromised by internal and external factors, i.e., both by the organization and modus operandi of aid agencies on the ground, and by an extremely volatile and dangerous operating environment.The aid community in
        Afghanistan faces severe challenges that need to be urgently addressed so that civilians in need can be protected and assisted and the credibility of the humanitarian enterprise restored. Opportunities for more principled humanitarian action, by separating or insulating it from political and military agendas, should not be missed. Failure to do so will have dire consequences for Afghans and for the future of humanitarianism worldwide.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d42b6d59c8b181d709f44e8573c3c724" level="item"><did><unittitle>Afghanistan: Humanitarianism Unraveled?</unittitle><unitid>UA197.001.DO.00019</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Donini, Antonio</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010/2010">2010</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b55fdc21042c4476744981f7eb519d31"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ef02351b4d0c1a26cc170bee44a6516c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This publication expands on the briefing paper on Afghanistan issued in March 2009, taking into account developments in the past year.

The population experiences chronic food insecurity, little access to basic services, the weakening of traditional livelihood systems, ongoing insecurity, human rights violations and a near complete lack of law and order institutions. Armed raiding of livestock and associated loss of life and destruction of property are common and pervasive. Economic investment and development is minimal due to the threat of road ambushes and lack of transport and communication infrastructure. Attention to the region, however, on the part of national and international agencies, donors, and Ugandan legislators is growing. This field-based report provides an in-depth analysis of key aspects affecting livelihood strategies and human security in the region, as well as broad recommendations for local, national and international actors seeking to expand their knowledge, policies or programming in the Karamoja

Joint operations with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) which now rules the autonomous region have failed to dislodge the LRA, which has broadened its area of operations. After abandoning peace talks and refusing to surrender himself to the International Criminal Court, Joseph Kony, the LRA leader, has redeployed his forces over wide areas astride the borders of Sudan, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. The LRA continues to terrorize civilians. To date there has been little analysis of the role of the UPDF in South Sudan. Based on fieldwork in the two locations where the UPDF has been garrisoned Feinstein International Center researcher Clement Ochan produces evidence from Sudanese civilians and officials that the Ugandan military has failed to
        vigorously pursue the LRA. Civilians and officials alike allege the government of Uganda is spinning out the conflict which Uganda has presented as an integral part of the Global War on Terror in order to secure Western military assistance. Have ill-disciplined UPDF and SPLA soldiers been more interested in securing benefits for themselves than winning the war? Could the Dinka-dominated SPLA do more to protect members of minority communities many of whom did not necessarily support the struggle to liberate South Sudan from LRA attacks? This report informs the background to the current crisis in the region and discussions about whether local and international policy-makers should rely primarily on military force to protect civilians from the ongoing threat posed by the LRA.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Conflict</subject><subject source="local">Armaments</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_7fe3c80dc163a64b4376761a35fe9d56" level="item"><did><unittitle>Out-Human beings--Migrations, Return, and Resettlement in Karamoja, Uganda: The case of Kobulin, Bokora County</unittitle><unitid>UA197.004.004.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stites, Elizabeth</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mazurana, Dyan</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Akabwai, Darlington</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007-06-07/2007-06-07">2007-06-07</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_307cdd88129f98aae555e2bd21b5e662"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b13478afca50f401402e4a0c003274e8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>As part of a larger project entitled "Livelihoods and Human Security in Karamoja," this briefing paper presents findings on causal factors and broad patterns in out-Human beings--Migrations among the Bokora population.

The study set out to better understand local views on this topic in response to the assumption in policy circles that resource scarcity or competition drives the Conflict, Armed (War) in this pastoral and agro-pastoral area. We found that while sites of natural resource exploitation are often insecure, respondents in the study population did not attribute this to direct Conflict, Armed (War) over the resources themselves. Rather, violence is common in these locations because opposing groups are most likely to come into contact with each other at these sites. On the flip side, respondents stressed that peace allows for better sharing of resources and better management of resource scarcity in times of stress or
        hardship.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Conflict, Armed (War)</subject><subject source="local">Natural resources</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bb0174432a5d8ec304d76db5df397695" level="item"><did><unittitle>Forced Marriage within the Lord's Resistance Army</unittitle><unitid>UA197.004.004.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Carlson, Khristopher</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mazurana, Dyan</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008-08-14/2008-08-14">2008-08-14</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6746429126a3828e79d305a22c2ea3bc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6bb451ccd354a40371a326687dceb8eb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>"Forced Marriage within the Lord's Resistance Army, Uganda" demonstrates that forced marriage includes acts codified as crimes in international customary and human rights law.

As a result of the links between the upheavals in these three areas, a vicious cycle of interlocked armed Conflict, Armed (War) and insecurity exists across the region. Yet the current policy of key international donor governments, the World Bank, the United Nations, and the African Union of addressing these Conflict, Armed (War)s in relative isolation may ultimately guarantee that armed Conflict, Armed (War) continues in the region. Regardless of the optimism surrounding the current peace agreement between the government of Sudan (GoS) and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), given the existing conditions on the ground, it is likely that this region will continue to be mired in violence and crises unless policymakers and donors adapt their perspective to take into account the larger

The Feinstein International Center views this as one step to building a long-term partnership with WFP Sudan.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Nutrition</subject><subject source="local">Food security</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_20067c8bd4379e03c5d3a79b05f4296f" level="item"><did><unittitle>Strategies for Economic Recovery and Peace In Darfur</unittitle><unitid>UA197.005.005.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Young, Helen</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Osman, Abdal Monium</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dale, Rebecca</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007-07-30/2007-07-30">2007-07-30</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4acdbe978931f65b3e95d2ff4b1591a0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_34e6e82456e12226705092b58b83b1b2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Competing livelihoods in the absence of good local governance has led to localized and ultimately devastating Conflict, Armed (War) over natural resources in Darfur. The lack of comprehensive livelihoods analysis in international peace processes and humanitarian assistance risks entrenching the Darfur Conflict, Armed (War) even further. Livelihoods analysis is a prerequisite for ensuring that resources are allocated according to need between competing livelihood groups i.e. impartiality of humanitarian response, and for appropriate planning/implementation of future recovery and development. To date, the humanitarian response has favoured certain groups while marginalizing others, specifically the Abbala arabs. Based upon intensive field research and consultation, this briefing note explains the background to the livelihoods and economic crisis in the Darfur region, and lays out specific recommendations for how it can be addressed.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Peace-building</subject><subject source="local">Economic recovery in Africa</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d7964aa4793755e678b5db5ea9ccb049" level="item"><did><unittitle>Darfur: Livelihoods Under Seige</unittitle><unitid>UA197.005.005.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Young, Helen</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Osman, Abdul Monim</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Aklilu, Yacob</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Dale, Rebecca</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Badri, Babiker</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fuddle, Abdul Jabbar Abdullah</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2005-07-08/2005-07-08">2005-07-08</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_80263456f997db442478ed1ddb235c23"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_931e7a4f031c9587c6c3a308a70ac65a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>It is almost two years since the beginning of the rebel insurgency in Darfur, but the Conflict, Armed (War) continues, the ceasefire has been frequently violated, and the world's worst humanitarian crisis continues to deepen.

The Maoists' rise to power was impressive by any standard. After a successful showing at the polls for the Constituent Assembly in April 2008, they became the strongest organized political force in the country. At the same time, foreign aid has been a fixture of Nepal's development efforts since the 1950s: the donor community has been the key partner in Nepal's development successes and failures. How did these two realitiesthe insurgency and foreign aidinteract? The report explores this question through a retrospective analysis of the development/conflict nexus in Nepal. It looks at the underlying causes of the Maoist success story, in relation to the conditions of structural underdevelopment and violence, and at donors' policies and activities in Nepal and at their interplay with the conflict environment. The report focuses on the last decade (1996-2008), the period of the Maoist insurgency
        and of the subsequent largely successful peace process. It looks at the way in which aid actors in Nepal framed their understanding of the Maoist insurgency and at how they adapted their responses. It shows that, because the aid community was Kathmandu-centric, it did not fully grasp the nature of caste, class and ethnic discrimination in rural Nepal nor that "development" was not benefiting the most disadvantaged groups. Development failure can thus be construed as a contributing factor to the insurgency.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian aid</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d2d8202006c7ac1fea8dffa720a0b859" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards a "Great Transformation"?: The Maoist Insurgency and Local Perceptions of Social Transformation in Nepal</unittitle><unitid>UA197.006.006.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sharma, Jeevan Raj</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Donini, Antonio</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010-07-27/2010-07-27">2010-07-27</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_641250593feb635efe828fbb5a423cd1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c24dc4287a3195803d625f3f5ab821f3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This report presents the findings of a two-year field research project on local perceptions of social transformation in rural Nepal. The findings, and our interpretations of them, are presented in a manner that can contribute not only to scholarly debate but also to current discussions on development policy choices and on the role of aid agencies. Our study shows that alongside the political transition, there is clear evidence of a qualitative "step-change" in the way Nepali society is organized that is beyond the continual or "normal" processes of incremental change that are always at work. Field evidence clearly suggests that many existing social norms and patterns are being challenged and are being reconstructed.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Conflict, Armed (War)</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_b5ac5209f5c8f9f253c2978c26fd90f1" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Preparing for Humanitarian Crises of the Future</unittitle><unitid>UA197.007</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">10 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2004/2010" type="inclusive">2004 -- 2010</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5f84513cc9263dc883d8ddc923f7de78"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Preparing for Humanitarian Crises of the Future project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_1166c9cd22ce252238f98416f2e01149"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_0ccaabba6fe249e532b70dd199da140a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_b650dd8cc4b92b9b45681c1828fe6865" level="item"><did><unittitle>Ambiguity and Change: Humanitarian NGOs Prepare for the Future</unittitle><unitid>UA197.007.007.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Donini, Antonio</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Borrel, Annalies</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kent, Randolph</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Minear, Larry</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Moomaw, William</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mowjee, Tasneem</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Najam, Adil</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Purdin, Susan</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Walker, Peter</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wisner, Ben</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_aab36729027789be3d56587b119fdda9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e512e7c8ad922c0db3903eb2f9fa4d1c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study provides international NGOs with a rudimentary framework for strategic planning in the light of the likely challenges of ambiguity and change awaiting them during the next decade.

Part two then considers the development of the Participatory Impact Assessment (PIA) methodology by the Feinstein International Center and its application, and the extent to which the challenges outlined in Part one have been addressed by these and other recent developments.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e94b6dbc6561826ab77d21a23d7078d1" level="item"><did><unittitle>One for All and All for One: Support and Assistance Models for an Effective IFRC</unittitle><unitid>UA197.007.007.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Walker, Peter</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Minear, Larry</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004-08-04/2004-08-04">2004-08-04</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3156201b2fee3e82d6844fb866a44f3d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_63527863f704e61df4a5f47cd67614c5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In recent years and for a variety of reasons, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has been buffeted by an array of forces. In one sense, the pressures are similar to those experienced by other federations, perhaps accentuated by the fact that the IFRC is one of the earliest and developed into the largest such federated, or federal, institutions. Like other federations, the IFRC is struggling with a set of generic problems. These include being a faithful representative at the global level of diverse national member societies and needs; promoting coordination of members which often comes with a great temptation to directly implement projects; and finding a workable balance between the federalism of the past and the increasingly profile-conscious bilateral and unilateral actions of its membership. The Federation has also been faced with managing the increasingly intense competition within the humanitarian sector which involves
        traditional humanitarian actors but now also for-profit entrepreneurs and military forces engaged in civic action work.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_82e9bdccdcc51bb071913cb2107fae28" level="item"><did><unittitle>One for All and All for One: Intra-Organizational Dynamics in Humanitarian Action</unittitle><unitid>UA197.007.007.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Webster, Mackinnon</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Walker, Peter</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009-05-29/2009-05-29">2009-05-29</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d93d123c14f920b375b230fa849ce4b9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_65e1d1c61d217420289c9123f5c94a04"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A significant proportion of humanitarian assistance is now delivered by NGOs which have in effect become federated trans-national organizations, alliances of members from different countries, all seeking to provide assistance in times of crisis.

Both sides committed grave human rights abuses and hundreds of thousands of civilians fl ed attacks on villages, kidnappings, and severe persecution based on ethnicity, nationality, or political opinion. Especially targeted were northern nationals and immigrants from Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Many internally displaced people migrated to urban centers such as Abidjan, Grand Bassam, and Yamoussoukro, but in urban centers they were subject to government harassment, including, in Abidjan, demolition of housing and attacks. Three peace agreements brokered between 2003 and 2005 failed, but the signing of the Ouagadougou Peace Agreement in March 2007 raised hopes for a return to stability, and many IDPs have spontaneously started to return to their areas of origin.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Conflict, Armed (War)</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ff742a232d8dca1a55b37277e1c264f8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Beyond men pikin: Improving understanding of post-Conflict, Armed (War) child fostering in Sierra Leone</unittitle><unitid>UA197.008.008.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gale, Lacey</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008-04-25/2008-04-25">2008-04-25</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c4c2c06b33a2316b0ab14add0d907e94"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_511fcaf1bc0e1fe64ae101bb77f3aac6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>There is growing agreement that separated Children--Crimes against are best cared for in community settings, rather than in institutions.

Without a transparent, humane and lawful asylum policy for Burmese people entering Thailand, it is impossible to estimate the percentage of bona fide refugees that are mixed into the group of migrants who have left Burma solely for other reasons. The lack of systematic data to document the reasons people flee Burma provides the Thai authorities with the excuse to treat the Burmese living outside the refugee camps as mere economic migrants, subject to deportation. It also weakens the leverage that agencies working with the Burmese living in Thailand have to advocate on their behalf.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_22bd8553cf76de4efbeff30217992c82" level="item"><did><unittitle>Internal Displacement to Urban Areas: the Tufts-IDMC Profiling Study (Khartoum, Sudan)</unittitle><unitid>UA197.008.008.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jacobsen, Karen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008-08-27/2008-08-27">2008-08-27</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_26a8f6454d48c930e687f8cab1c0196b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c1e369b7d594b8318900febd3dcf6800"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In recent decades Sudan's North-South civil war and the Conflict, Armed (War) in Darfur have generated one of the largest internally displaced populations in the world.

Refugees are seen to impose a variety of economic and environmental burdens on host countries, and to create or aggravate security threats. However, for the past twenty years, refugee flows have also been accompanied by a significant resource transfer in the form of international humanitarian assistance and human capital. Refugee camps have become the repositories of such resources as relief supplies and food aid, vehicles, communication equipment, and other locally valued and scarce materials. The refugees themselves bring human capital in the form of labor, skills and education. In addition, refugees are, if only for a brief burst of international media attention, a highly visible phenomenon, capable of
        focusing attention on regions normally lost to the public eye. They therefore represent political leverage for savvy actors in the region. Thus, a sustained injection of material, social and political 'refugee resources' is suddenly available in a receiving region. In most African host countries, however, refugee hosting areas are poor and underdeveloped, and commonly experience increased security problems with a refugee influx.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6bf4788f7c6f75ce171497cc34135b3d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Alchemy Field Report on FCC Micro Credit Programs to Refugees in Mozambique</unittitle><unitid>UA197.008.008.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Omata, Naohiko</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004-12-21/2004-12-21">2004-12-21</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0ceeb9256834c65f86f24a95ce53d195"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5bff3d682254dc6d3d0b588d77b4e506"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper is a report by an Alchemy intern at Fundo de Credito Communtario (FCC) in Mozambique for the summer of 2004.

The Alchemy Project based at the Alan Shawn Feinstein International Famine Centre at Tufts University, situated in Medford, MA, USA, focuses its research on ways of enabling refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to re-establish their livelihoods in African host countries and communities. The Alchemy Project provides capital for loans to local partners who are providing micro credit services to IDPs and refugees. In exchange the local partners participate in the research process of the project through data collection activities and the
        feedback they give to Alchemy staff on their programs. The research presented here was conducted among urban refugees, refugee service providers and local microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Johannesburg. All data collected is accessible at the Alchemy Project offices.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><subject source="local">Internally displaced persons</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0e12e3d13446838e3d6d34f07f8e8a60" level="item"><did><unittitle>Alchemy Project: Report for Field Visit with Cord in Zambia</unittitle><unitid>UA197.008.008.00015</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Titus, Sarah</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004-12-21/2004-12-21">2004-12-21</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3ccc017902342d0bfca143753d66d2bf"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_0096022cd733ac331909dce03e123db3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The overarching purpose of the Alchemy Project's site visit to our partner organization CORD (Christian Outreach, Relief and Development) in Zambia was to collect data on its micro-credit program and other income generating and livelihood support programs, provide technical assistance and work with the organization to establish a baseline survey instrument that will be used on an ongoing basis to monitor and evaluate the micro-credit program currently operating in Nangweshi refugee camp.

A protracted refugee situation is one in which refugees have been 'stuck' for a period of time2 beyond their initial displacement, where they are unable to return to their homes, and no solutions to their predicament are in sight. One of the defining characteristics of protracted refugee situations is the rapid decline in the supply of humanitarian assistance, including food aid. Agencies now increasingly recognize the need to support the efforts of displaced people to pursue their own livelihoods, but there are few resources available. Aid agencies have experimented with interventions such as income generating or cash-forwork programs, but these are often the first programs to be cut, and in general they are not well resourced, understood or evaluated.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Microfinance.</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><subject source="local">Internally displaced persons</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_fe487e133c9261c25f88bed5b51a45b2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Refugee Youth and Community in Boston: Negotiating School and Community Relations</unittitle><unitid>UA197.008.008.00020</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Raven Roberts, Angela</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2003-10-22/2003-10-22">2003-10-22</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e29a85266ed66ea519d18c910b4a3532"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_dc135b37bb4dac2ff6c1373052d26e0e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Boston is a major resettlement city for many refugees coming from crisis and war affected countries around the world.

There is controversy around this issue. A widely held belief is that refugees and IDPs are worse off in urban settings, because they have lost their assets and social networks, and lack secure housing, land and property rights, and the cultural knowledge required to survive in a city. Others have argued that refugees are not necessarily more vulnerable than other migrants, and these differences are eroded over time. In particular, some research suggests that international migrants, including refugees, are often better equipped to deal with cities than newly urbanized citizens of the host country. Whether refugees and IDPs are more economically vulnerable and at greater risk is one of the questions we explore in this research.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><subject source="local">Internally displaced persons</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0c6090180b894c76776528edca9928c7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Remittances to Transit Countries</unittitle><unitid>UA197.008.008.00026</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jacobsen, Karen</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ayoub, Maysa</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Johnson, Alice</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012-10-01/2012-10-01">2012-10-01</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2c6b6de7824f7885eb10e8f664d466cc">One important gap in the literature on refugees' and international migrants' remittances concerns flows between developing countries.

In the east of the African continent, Egypt and Kenya are countries of first asylum for Sudanese and Somalis, but also transit settings for refugees and other migrants seeking to migrate to Europe, North America or the Gulf.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d11d7731043b83743b8de83d82cac8ed"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Egypt</geogname><subject source="local">Migration</subject><subject source="local">Refugees</subject><subject source="local">Emigrant remittances</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_3d2a22bfca6323a06d9d93e09eb1cd5a" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Livelihood Programming for Disaster Risk Reduction</unittitle><unitid>UA197.009</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">2 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2010/2010" type="inclusive">2010</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b0180fe3e512d8c6100a728854a6b859"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Livelihood Programming for Disaster Risk Reduction project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_6f1d466f64de2939ccbec90b12f441ff"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_fba9b2e92fc753f237276f92b478aa7e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_f9d6511f16a16bd04dbf97b890ab13bb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Baseline Report: Africa Community Resilience Project (Tsaeda Amba Woreda, Eastern Tigray, Ethiopia)</unittitle><unitid>UA197.009.009.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Maxwell, Daniel</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tadesse, Girum</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mukwavi, Mary</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hailu, Shimelis</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Zewold, Wolde Gebreal</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gebrekiros, Abraha</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010-01-06/2010-01-06">2010-01-06</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_972b79b909006bd2620139b240dd4a63"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_573c018ff53f7f35aa74fc9810a43a9a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programs encompass many different kinds of activities, but share the fundamental objective of enhancing the capacity of vulnerable communities to identify, reduce and manage risk, whether it be at the local, regional or national level.

One of the most significant problems facing a disaster-affected population is the need for ready cash. In a post-disaster context cash is difficult to come by for a variety of reasons. A useful approach then, to enable recovery and reduce risk, is to identify effective ways to enable households to access (or hold onto) a lump sum of ready cash. This paper outlines the meaning of household financial resilience and its relationship to the household's cash position. It then explores the impact of different kinds of hazards on the cash position of affected households and how different approaches - both existing humanitarian assistance and livelihood ones, and recent innovations - have addressed financial resilience, drawing on a range of case studies. The paper specifically highlights insurance,
        savings, and credit as a means by which households can raise a lump sum and sure up their financial resilience.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Disaster relief--Developing countries</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_8c47f886e6643e69664e0532dbb25034" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Livelihoods Change Over Time</unittitle><unitid>UA197.010</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2010/2012" type="inclusive">2010 -- 2012</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ced2caba8a95532a75b099ec83dd14dc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Livelihoods Change Over Time project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_319721ea1b2f34b42438c00d2aab799b"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_c3429f8ec8698b16db9a3d6eb41498f2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_255f309a97f9d69ec7eb3aca28d35c26" level="item"><did><unittitle>Institutional Assessment Report: Tsaeda Amba Woreda, Eastern Tigray, Ethiopia</unittitle><unitid>UA197.010.010.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Coates, Jennifer</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Maxwell, Daniel</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tadesse, Girum</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hailu, Shimelis</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nugussie, Woldegebrial Zeweld</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gebrekiros, Abraha</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010-06-22/2010-06-22">2010-06-22</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7607c2f2390a33a3d44c82439670e153"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_8f18119f9e86b22548422db484411398"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Based on data collected in January 2010 through focus groups and household-level interviews in Tsaeda Amba woreda, this assessment depicts the breadth of institutional constraints to risk reduction and livelihood security.

However, recently there has been an increasing recognition of the importance and value of disaster risk reduction (DRR) programming. This comes from the understanding that though humanitarian efforts are important and required in the aftermath of a disaster, a comprehensive view of risk and vulnerability are important elements in preventing, reducing and mitigating the negative impacts of shocks on lives and livelihoods. Even though DRR has been recognized as invaluable, it still remains a somewhat nebulous concept, and includes elements of programming that are named various different things: mitigation, prevention, "building back better," etc. Many organizations continue to struggle with what exactly DRR encompasses and how to incorporate it into their mandate. This review is the first output of a three year research program looking at the intersection of
        DRR and livelihoods and is intended to clarify DRR concepts and programming elements, identify good practice, and assess the impact of DRR programs on livelihood outcomes, assets, and institutions. The purpose of this review is to establish baseline definitions and trends, review existing literature and suggest gaps in knowledge that will help to focus the content of the subsequent field case studies.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Economies and societies in transition</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_068e3bb3c3b5f76125f487f1c2eb73a5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Final Report: Africa Community Resilience Programme, Tsaeda Amba Woreda, Eastern Tigray, Ethiopia</unittitle><unitid>UA197.010.010.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Maxwell, Daniel</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Coates, Jennifer</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tadesse, Girum</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Abdissa, Fayera</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hailu, Shimelis</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shishigu, Eyasu</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nugussie, Woldegebrial Zeweld</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mezgebe, Kinfe</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gebrekiros, Abraha</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011-02-20/2011-02-20">2011-02-20</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5efe1bb97c3811fb183e4aee68e7112c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_37eacf42893ccb9f460d8f63c00bd59c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programs encompass many different kinds of activities, but share the fundamental objective of enhancing the capacity of vulnerable communities to identify, reduce and manage risk, whether it be at the local, regional or national level. Ethiopia is one of the most food-insecure countries in the world, but only recently has the food security problem begun to be understood in terms of a complete analysis of livelihoods, rather than simply a food supply problem. New disaster risk management policies in Ethiopia address this issue nation-wide. The Africa Community Resilience Project (ACRP) was designed by World Vision International in line with the Hyogo Framework for Action as a blueprint to creating resilient communities. The project is research-based and will build capacity for improving resilience through disaster risk management programming and mainstreaming in one area of Tigray Region. Tufts University was engaged to conduct the
        research and programmatic learning side of the program. This final report covers the last round of the participatory impact assessment conducted in Tsaeda Amba Woreda in Eastern Tigray in July 2010, and summarizes findings from both rounds of the household survey. These results demonstrate the impact of the drought and the high price of food in 2008 and 2009. Results also demonstrate the impact of ACRP in terms of capacity building, establishing and consolidating Community Disaster Preparedness Committee and mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction into on-going programs.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Economies and societies in transition</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4bf8cee47dcb78ab9b6d9c55f62b3cab" level="item"><did><unittitle>Resilience and Livelihods Change in Tigray, Ethiopia</unittitle><unitid>UA197.010.010.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Vaitla, Bapu</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Tesfay, Girmay</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rounseville, Megan</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Maxwell, Daniel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012-11-01/2012-11-01">2012-11-01</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e5a164ae87f31c4458e0e5928d91728e">Resilience is the ability of an individual, a household, a community or an institution to withstand a shock or setback of some type and recover, or "bounce back," after a setback. As such, it implies the ability to cope with adversity by adapting, learning and innovating. Resilience has become an important operational concept in chronically vulnerable or food insecure areas of the world. Humanitarian assistance or safety net programs may be able to prevent mortality or reduce malnutrition in the face of shocks or crises, but households, their communities and their institutions may still not fully recover from the effects of the shock. In a recent policy review, the UK Department for International Development (DFID 2011) defines resilience as "the ability of countries, communities and households to manage change, by maintaining or transforming living standards in the face of shocks or stresses - such as earthquakes, drought or violent conflict - without compromising their long-term prospects."</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4f9a1cd07e627df907a9011525e474a9"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Tigray Region (Ethiopia)</geogname><subject source="local">Economic stabilization</subject><subject source="local">Economies and societies in transition</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_215be1492eebb6dfb015e8af36594108" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Understanding the Future of Pastoralism in Africa</unittitle><unitid>UA197.011</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">9 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2001/2011" type="inclusive">2001 -- 2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_359d4d867e9e80981a9e2ea27202a21d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Understanding the Future of Pastoralism in Africa project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_879e78f7deee9433512d342c8c39806f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_096be8b079eb4f9cdaa1fc6803eb66d1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_c32602dc27d12d328c7b61e93f701aac" level="item"><did><unittitle>Livelihoods-based Drought Response in Ethiopia: Impact Assessment of Livestock Feed Supplementation</unittitle><unitid>UA197.011.011.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bekele, Gezu</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Tsehay Abera</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2008-10-15/2008-10-15">2008-10-15</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f16cf84e119488e5a553927375b778b3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3412204ff6668666d35f0eee2a7d72ac"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Since the drought in some pastoralist areas of Ethiopia in 2005 to 2006, there has been increasing interest in the use of supplementary feeding for Livestock as part of an integrated drought response. Over time, and with more attention to the need for early response, NGOs are working to intervene more rapidly and improve modes of implementation. In terms of the livelihoods-based approaches promoted by the USAID Pastoralist Livelihoods Initiative, the livelihoods objectives of Livestock supplementary feeding are to protect the key assets of pastoralists and promote post-drought recovery. However, Livestock supplementary feeding is not universally accepted as an appropriate drought response intervention. For those actors following a conventional humanitarian approach of saving human lives, feed for Livestock might be regarded as a distraction from the core business of Food relief for people. Livestock feed supplementation also involves considerable costs, with some
        workers suggesting that these costs are somehow excessive or inappropriate.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Pastoral systems</subject><subject source="local">Livestock</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_43bec6db812fbebd255a7a35faa6b40e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Livestock Marketing in Kenya and Ethiopia: A Review of Policies and Practice</unittitle><unitid>UA197.011.011.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Aklilu, Yacob</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008-11-13/2008-11-13">2008-11-13</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3761383a353a248b0e7df781a33fa93b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a53203ff50998b68b04471f7e832eb08"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The paper reviews selected Livestock marketing policy and some operational issues in both Kenya and Ethiopia.

These assessments are part of a broader longitudinal impact study of the PSNP Plus project, which targets poor, rural households in food insecure areas that benefit from the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). The goal of PSNP Plus is to move households towards graduation from PSNP through market-driven approaches to diversify their livelihoods, build assets and link to financial services and markets. The PSNP Plus project started in the last quarter of 2008 and aims to link PSNP participants to both formal microfinance and (in the interim or absence of this) to informal microfinance by establishing Savings and Internal Lending Communities (SILC). The project also attempts to link PSNP households to markets through the development of different types of commodity value chains. The PSNP Plus project in Sire and Dodota is
        supporting four value chains; cereals, white pea beans, honey and small ruminant fattening. This study specifically focused on collecting data on income and assets of households participating in the projects cereal and livestock value chains. This baseline will be used for assessing the impact of the project against these indicators during a final impact assessment in 2011.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Microfinance.</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_75ca5e7f6c27b98d6d02a5a94e6d97ee" level="item"><did><unittitle>Livestock and Livelihoods in Emergencies: Lessons Learnt from the 1999-2001 Emergency Response in the Pastoral Section in Kenya</unittitle><unitid>UA197.011.011.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Aklilu, Yacob</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wekesa, Mike</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001-09-26/2001-09-26">2001-09-26</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_efebc5565dcb896206aa37645ca7922a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_ce7114eed3d699d227eae2771b7ef01f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The aim of this paper is to document and share the experiences and lessons learnt from drought-related livestock-based interventions carried out during the 1999-2001 drought in Kenya.

This exercise establishes a portfolio of experience to aid in planning and implementing similar or related interventions in future.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Pastoral systems</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><subject source="local">Livestock</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_89aac47eface7c2f97df5da235e8c61c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Pastoralist Community Harmonization in the Karamoja Cluster: Taking it to the Next Level</unittitle><unitid>UA197.011.011.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Minear, Larry</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2002-03-15/2002-03-15">2002-03-15</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c465d57561588dff39920c32456f0d21"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9b99754d86033afbaedb558f6c1d57c3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This assessment was undertaken at the request of OAU/IBAR's CAPE Unit and the Feinstein International Famine Center, which supports the Unit's work through secunded personnel and other contributed resources. 1 The study focuses on the impacts of the Pastoral Community Harmonization Initiative (PCHI), now in its fourth year (Section 2 below.)

This report describes a relatively new trend in pastoralist livestock marketing, being a dynamic response to increasing demand for camels in mid-altitude areas of Ethiopia, and in neighboring Sudan. In response, a camel trade network has evolved that covers about 2000km, involves more than six ethnic groups, and is served by 24 markets. Within Ethiopia, the rising demand for camels by mid-altitude farmers is associated with the drought-tolerant nature of camels and their multiple uses as pack animals, and reflects an important cultural shift among Orthodox Christians. Emerging in the absence of aid or government programs, the camel trade shows how economic synergies between pastoralist and non-pastoralist areas can develop, and provides
        further evidence of the market responsiveness of pastoralists, even when faced by drought and other constraints.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Pastoral systems</subject><subject source="local">Economies and societies in transition</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_01c05688a63ac156427821666279b46e" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Livelihoods and Nutrition of Marginalized People</unittitle><unitid>UA197.012</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">24 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2000/2011" type="inclusive">2000 -- 2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_04598ba5697378e766c7f6d9569f4cd1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Livelihoods and Nutrition of Marginalized People project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_3ac921a4187d074675450dfe07172bd3"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_fe4ce72916183a68d7bf5f058955f760"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_7fdb1e78de734b75dfba5eddc5a8ed24" level="item"><did><unittitle>Human Security and Livelihoods of Rural Afghans</unittitle><unitid>UA197.012.012.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mazurana, Dyan</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stites, Elizabeth</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nojumi, Neamat</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2004-07-06/2004-07-06">2004-07-06</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_47c81d4fa35484a4aaafdb2f2743f724"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_27e4321b6e0527442b8c2dca96435c4d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This report documents and analyzes recent countrywide trends in the relationship between human security and livelihoods throughout rural Afghanistan from 2002-2003.

Mettant cette expérience à profit, ce guide est destiné à fournir aux praticiens un vaste cadre de référence pour réaliser des Évaluations d'impact participatives (ÉIP) au niveau des projets des interventions sur les moyens de subsistance dans le secteur humanitaire. À l'exception de certaines interventions relatives à la santé, à la Nutrition ou à l'eau dans lesquelles les indicateurs de rendement de projet doivent correspondre aux normes internationales, pour de nombreuses interventions il n'existe pas d'« étalon-or » pour mesurer l'impact des projets. Par exemple, le manuel Sphere ne contient pas de normes claires concernant la
        sécurité alimentaire ou les interventions relatives aux moyens de subsistance. Ce guide vise à combler cette lacune en présentant une approche essayée et testée pour mesurer l'impact des projets axés sur les moyens de subsistance.

Con base en esta experiencia, esta guía busca ofrecer un amplio marco a los profesionales en este campo con el propósito de llevar a cabo evaluaciones participativas del impacto (EPI) a nivel de los proyectos, específicamente en las intervenciones del sector humanitario en los medios de sustento. A excepción de algunas intervenciones en los campos de la salud, la nutrición y el agua —, en las que los indicadores del desempeño de los proyectos se deben relacionar con las normas internacionales establecidas—, para muchas intervenciones no existen 'reglas de oro' para medir el impacto de los proyectos. Por ejemplo, el Manual de Esfera no incluye normas claras para las intervenciones en el
        campo de la seguridad alimentaria o en los medios de sustento. Por lo tanto, esta guía busca salvar la brecha existente al describir un enfoque que ya se ha sometido a prueba para medir el impacto de los proyectos relativos a los medios de sustento. No obstante, la guía no pretende brindar un conjunto de normas o de indicadores, ni tampoco un plan para evaluar el impacto, sino que busca ofrecer un marco amplio y flexible que pueda adaptarse a los diferentes contextos e intervenciones de los proyectos.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Impact assessment</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3b3a3da541c1748b9058a8fdd198d2eb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Review of Nutrition and Mortality Indicators for the IPC: Reference Levels and Decision-making</unittitle><unitid>UA197.012.012.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Young, Helen</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jaspers, Suzanne</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009-11-23/2009-11-23">2009-11-23</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4f010555f2e745b33080644f58a6ca5f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3017afb3c5154a0053f795a7aa067fc2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Nutrition and mortality indicators have long been used to guide decision-makers in humanitarian and development programmes.

Other than in some health, Nutrition, and water interventions in which indicators of project performance should relate to international standards, for many interventions there are no 'gold standards' for measuring project impact. This guide aims to bridge this gap by outlining a tried and tested approach to measuring the impact of livelihoods projects. The tools in the guide have been field tested over the past two years in a major research effort, funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and involving five major humanitarian NGOs working across Africa.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Impact assessment</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_5805442145a5b1766ac97e945c8a5877" level="item"><did><unittitle>Risk and Vulnerability in Ethiopia: Learning from the Past, Responding to the Present, Preparing for the Future</unittitle><unitid>UA197.012.012.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lautze, Sue</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Aklilu, Yacob</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Raven-Roberts, Angela</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Young, Helen</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kebede, Girma</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Leaning, Jennifer</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003-07-13/2003-07-13">2003-07-13</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_373e1bad4ef50cfd3f6f36714db1535f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_762518039c46b8ad5c1aa606e674f56d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The people of Ethiopia today are managing the risks and vulnerabilities generated by a serious drought, profound vulnerability to disease epidemics (human, crop and Livestock), and a combination of local and international economic forces and domestic and international policies. The combined efforts of government, donors, UN agencies, NGOs and Ethiopian communities have helped vulnerable populations to avert the worst of this crisis, but alarming losses of life, emergency levels of malNutrition and crippling losses of livelihood assets have nevertheless been experienced, particularly by marginalized communities on the periphery. Much more can be done to immediately reduce the impact of the current crisis.

Undermining self-sufficiency and productivity are not merely by-products of conflict, but also are the intended consequences of war. In complex emergencies, systems of production are particularly vulnerable, rendering these types of disasters fundamentally different from natural disasters. Consequently, innovative approaches to providing relief and recovery assistance are essential. Tools for analyzing the critical trade-offs between implementing more immediate survival interventions and fostering self-sufficiency to ensure longer-term survival, i.e., saving lives and livelihoods, are much-needed by the international humanitarian relief community.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><subject source="local">Conflict, Armed (War)</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d3af3c7bd00100b17d96e231c30c925e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Community Case Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition in Southern Bangladesh</unittitle><unitid>UA197.012.012.00023</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sadler, Kate</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Puett, Chloe</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mothabbit, Golam</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Myatt, Mark</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011-10-18/2011-10-18">2011-10-18</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_eac7a97aa36b17f1474cf91602c4abb0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3c8fd82d626feba84c03e7db8590e7f5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Bangladesh has the fourth-highest number of children around 600,000 at any one time suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in the world.

But what exactly should be integrated and how? This report represents a lessons learned assessment of an integrated agriculture, nutrition, and health intervention implemented in Malawi in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The review contributes to the ongoing international search for best practices in programming for food security. The Integrated Food Security Programme (IFSP) was designed as a self-reinforcing, synergistic program implemented in an area of extreme food insecurity. Nevertheless, the endline evaluation in 2004 reported that the intervention had achieved most of its aims. Child nutrition was improved (reaching the target set of a 10% reduction in the prevalence of stunting), and most
        sectoral targets in agriculture, income generating, and infrastructure development were also achieved. At roughly US$59 per household per year, the cost of the package of interventions integrated on the ground compares well with a range of other integrated programs in Malawi and elsewhere in the world. Importantly, many of the gains have been sustained.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Food security</subject><subject source="local">Nutrition</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_b6a1fc5b94e213c925f3197b8ea81b16" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>The Evolving Global Environment of Crisis and Crisis Response</unittitle><unitid>UA197.013</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">11 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2000/2011" type="inclusive">2000 -- 2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_92984dbff327b9b5d1a8504cf595c784"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to The Evolving Global Environment of Crisis and Crisis Response project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_682a8b358ba13249310a031b783454c1"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_5bd5a8312ee7a826f59f0772d412c4a2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_3af5f9858eb7cb23e32cb433db1d9924" level="item"><did><unittitle>State-building, Counterterrorism, and Licensing Humanitarianism in Somalia</unittitle><unitid>UA197.013.013.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bradbury, Mark</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2010-10-12/2010-10-12">2010-10-12</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_20faee86c692d2184072171a47873bf1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3ce3385af27c5a6751786abcd7373ac5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The people of Somalia have experienced two decades of humanitarian crisis.

The dominant voices in transition environments instead are those of peace support operations (PSOs) and assistance agencies (AAs). Even the voice of government is often muffled. Such a disconnect has major implications: if the perceptions of local communities were to be the entry point for outside actor engagement or the benchmark for the effectiveness of international assistance and peace support, a major re-thinking of the ways PSOs and AA's operate would be required.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ad3b324d30cdd519c102e339b6a7b84d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Complexity and Context as the Determinants of the Future</unittitle><unitid>UA197.013.013.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Walker, Peter</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008-07-28/2008-07-28">2008-07-28</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6f7efd95388af29cefb6bdf4f25787be"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_f80c28044ca4325c19b146ce8b35220c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Humanitarian crises today are not due to one underlying cause but rather to a set of complex issues or an accumulation of adverse trends.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_de51d0bf60f9c080780797958ae00a30" level="item"><did><unittitle>Humanitarian Action in Pakistan 2005-2010: Challenges, Principles, and Politics</unittitle><unitid>UA197.013.013.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">PÌ©chayre, Marion</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011-02-06/2011-02-06">2011-02-06</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9df2a65c9fcd8e5f6a54ad57d9e5caa4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4506d3af7d560896ef15251fde7fdd83"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Over the past five years, Pakistan has witnessed three major crises affecting up to 18 million people. The nature and scale of these crises were different. Two were disasters caused by natural hazards: the 2005 earthquake (affecting 3.5 million people) and the 2010 floods (affecting more than 20 million people). The 2008-2010 Internally Displaced People (IDP) crisis was triggered by an internal conflict and displaced 4.2 million people from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Facing these different and significant crises in such a short period of time, humanitarian actors had to adapt rapidly and faced dilemmas that were new to them in the context of Pakistan. This paper examines the impact of the three above-mentioned crises on the evolution of the humanitarian system and its ability to respond to emergencies in Pakistan since 2005. It follows a chronological order, looking first at the legacy of the 2005 earthquake response
        on the humanitarian system, and second at the influence it had on its ability to respond to the 2008-2010 IDP crisis, and finally it explores the challenges humanitarians had to face at the onset of the flood crisis.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_68f593cbf8315beceafe34d86a1ef0d2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Aid to Sudan's Rebels: Right Idea, Wrong Plan</unittitle><unitid>UA197.013.013.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lautze, Sue</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2000-02-09/2000-02-09">2000-02-09</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_132b8c2f8254a3d46ff19e70172d5305"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a0a8e212074ab3391a9b131a1fa1d33d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Terrorism, humanitarian and conflict-resolution issues keep Sudan a country of concern to US foreign policy makers.

Currently, the humanitarian system shows significant weaknesses in data collection, analysis and response in all stages of a crisis or emergency. As a result, the present humanitarian system is much less evidence-driven than it should be and than it would like to be. To ensure that vulnerabilities, needs and access to life-saving services are best understood and responded to, humanitarian actors must collect information based on sex and age. When this data is lacking, it limits the effectiveness of humanitarian response in all phases of a crisis.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><subject source="local">Children</subject><subject source="local">Impact assessment</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_4167239d6806a4c6c597ed68f4fbc1a4" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Impact Assessment</unittitle><unitid>UA197.014</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2005/2011" type="inclusive">2005 -- 2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fa6776ff91fc4c6c89e317adc858f118"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Impact Assessment project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_5aff3c4e5493714c193c877f944c0991"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_54fad46819a24153cca28ed022379821"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_2e6502259b961c72e8c379c091407522" level="item"><did><unittitle>Impact Assessment of the Zimbabwe Dams and Gardens Project</unittitle><unitid>UA197.014.014.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Burns, John</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Suji, Omeno W</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008-04-08/2008-04-08">2008-04-08</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4a50986ea3c3f884223b6254ea8572c4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_75929793282ecead30bc79a195eaf91a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study was an Impact assessment of the 'Zimbabwe Dams and Gardens' Project' a community based famine prevention and mitigation intervention being implemented by CARE International in Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe.

The 'Pastoralist Survival and Recovery Project' was designed to assist ten pastoral communities living in the Tarka Valley recover from the effects of a prolonged drought, culminating in locust attacks and a failed harvest in 2004. The project also aimed to enhance the capacity of pastoral communities to cope with the effects of future droughts and other shocks by ensuring year round access to food and income. The main project activities included the establishment of six Livestock feed banks, restocking of small ruminants, and the construction of four
        wells for both human and Livestock utilization. The impact study focused on the re-stocking and animal feed bank project interventions, and set out to assess what changes in household Food security and income had occurred as a result of the project. The study also looked at how the re-stocking activities might have potentially improved participants resilience to future droughts and other shocks.

This report examines the impact of a privatized, community-based veterinary service in the far northeast of Kenya, and focuses on the outcomes of clinical services provided by community-based Animal health workers (CAHWs). Fatality rates in herds in treated by CAHWs using medicines from rural pharmacies were significantly lower than in herds where treatments were provided by untrained Livestock keepers. The report adds to the substantial body of evidence already collected in Kenya on the impact and financial rationale for CAHW systems. Although many other countries have now legalized these systems and developed national guidelines for CAHW training, Kenya has yet to officially recognize CAHWs and overall, veterinary services in pastoralist areas often
        remain in the hands of untrained workers and unlicensed drug vendors.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Pastoral systems</subject><subject source="local">Livestock</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0b4893391d6184ea9db736430887b513" level="item"><did><unittitle>Addressing Integrated Coordination in Food Security Crises</unittitle><unitid>UA197.014.014.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Maxwell, Daniel</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Parker, John</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011-11-28/2011-11-28" type="inclusive">2011-11-28</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_88bdb431e103ced7aed32b180d6a09b8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9eba236b5b10b7f8c22c0ed2a6d089f6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In May 2011, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) formally launched the global Food Security Cluster (FSC) as the UNs global mechanism for coordinating food security responses in emergencies. The creation of the global cluster coincides with a period in which the number of food security actors has continued to grow, the operating environment has become more complex, and the range of responses has required greater levels of skill in analysis, planning, implementation and monitoring. All of this underscores the need for greater coordination. This paper summarizes the mandate of the newly formed global FSC, presents an analysis of the major issues and challenges it faces, and provides recommendations to donors and the global FSC for possible ways to address these issues. Issues addressed include the leadership of clusters and coordination; coordination linkages and challenges at the global level; transitions, exit and the boundaries
        of food security coordination in emergencies; accountability, effectiveness and funding. Addressing many of these issues will require broader coordination among actors and institutions that do not necessarily have similarly-aligned interests and incentives. However, the global FSC itself can do several things. First, given the myriad issues the global FSC faces, the cluster leadership can provide some strategic prioritizing. Second, while clusters exist for humanitarian purposes, it is clear that cluster coordination is more effective when good preparedness plans are in place and where longer-term concerns are taken into consideration in the acute emergency response. Finally, good leadership in the right place at the right time is a key component of an effective response and effective coordination, and ensuring this leadership is one of the challenges facing the global Cluster. Donors can provide support to the global FSC making clear the priorities they see at the global level
        and engaging at the country level where capacity exists; by supporting the global FSC to function as a main repository of experience and lessons learned; and by ensuring the expertise for innovative approaches is critical for strategic success.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Food security</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_a4d6573dd8ee90e6b2d9d96f40f55f5a" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Targeting in Complex Emergencies</unittitle><unitid>UA197.015</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2008/2009" type="inclusive">2008 -- 2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_39cb6101a88402fb73ecbf6243cb0bf3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Targeting in Complex Emergencies project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_6586eed22f5f4922e8ae2fa03ddfaeb0"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_aad4ad24b9139e3fcb73a59cbb7ae89d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_3896353926c08316c92238a8b5f14ec5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Targeting in Complex Emergencies: Somalia Country Case Study</unittitle><unitid>UA197.015.015.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jaspars, Susanne</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Maxwell, Daniel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2008-08-05/2008-08-05">2008-08-05</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ae446b4c57c2b4831854c05699085dab"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a646864e04e9572460da389dfc6575a3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study examined community participation throughout the Food relief program cycle to understand the role of recipient communities in the targeting of food assistance under the Conflict, Armed (War) conditions in Somalia, a country that has not had a central government since the fall of the President Siad Barre in 1991. Security considerations, limited staff numbers and other constraints have long meant that the actual oversight of what happens with Food relief must be left in the hands of local leaders at the village or camp level. The study found big differences in the accountability and legitimacy of local leadership in different locations, from clan elders and religious leaders in some locations, to "gate keepers" who control information, access, and resources in other locations, especially in IDP camps. Though "committees" of "local leaders" exist in both situations, the degree to which leaders actually represent the "community" differs enormously. The
        practice of redistribution of food assistance limits the number of people in any recipient community who are excluded from food assistance, but also ends up ensuring that no one receives very much. Most communities hold strong views that external assistance in the form of food should be shared equally within communities. But much of the process of Food relief targeting remains opaque to recipients. They are often not aware of their entitlements or the process of determining who is entitled. The report makes various suggestions for improving participation in targeting, and improving targeting generally.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Food security</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_270c54b1ca23224d6b564740e636f973" level="item"><did><unittitle>Targeting in Complex Emergencies: Darfur Case Study</unittitle><unitid>UA197.015.015.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Young, Helen</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Maxwell, Daniel</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009-05-12/2009-05-12">2009-05-12</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d0d19479d596a1cf4a4ce8accb9056cc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4ef4a3a782c509a02799cb2d24d8f484"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study examined community participation throughout the Food relief program cycle to understand the role of recipient communities in the targeting of food assistance under the Conflict, Armed (War) conditions in Darfur - one of the largest Food relief programs in the world.

This paper examines the effectiveness of one aspect of those efforts, namely the aid projects implemented by US Civil Affairs teams deployed from the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) in Garissa and Wajir districts in North Eastern province, and Lamu district in Coast province. The paper argues that these activities were useful at a tactical level in terms of facilitating the US military's entry into regions of potential concern, and in helping them to acquire local knowledge and connections. However, it also highlights some of the limitations at a strategic level of using foreign aid as a tool for countering terrorism or insurgencies and promoting stability and security. For example, the research found that these
        small-scale and scattered projects did little to win hearts and minds or change perceptions of the US in the communities where the projects were implemented. There was also little evidence that the projects had contributed to improved security by addressing some of the perceived underlying causes of terrorism and violent extremism in the region.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Conflict, Armed (War)</subject><subject source="local">Human Security</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_baf47ae5376debbcc489786a36be541c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Winning Hearts and Minds in Afghanistan?

Despite acceptance of the urgent need for risk reduction and drought mitigation there is still little understanding of the causes of malNutrition, and which interventions in the medium to long term should be prioritized to improve the health and Nutritional status of Children--Crimes against in these settings.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Children--Nutrition</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_e881673d0eb8dc0f88bde5927f821b75" level="item"><did><unittitle>Milk Matters in Karamoja: Milk in Childrens Diets and Household Livelihoods</unittitle><unitid>UA197.018.018.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stites, Elizabeth</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mitchard, Emily</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011-10-17/2011-10-17">2011-10-17</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bc5bff8cf11f2f437aec7a07d7100299"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_68855d378f38a336a5946b75cca75fb4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study, the latest under the collaborative initiative between the Feinstein International Center and Save the Children, examines changes in milk supply and uses by households in pastoral, agro-pastoral and agricultural livelihood zones in Karamoja. Using participatory methods of data collection, the research illustrates both how significant the loss of milk has been to diets and livelihoods and how households have responded to this loss. We find that households prioritize feeding any available milk to children at the expense of milk for all other household members and all other purposes. Nevertheless, the overall reduction of milk in the diets of children continues to have serious nutritional consequences that warrant further attention at the programming, policy and advocacy levels.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Children--Nutrition</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_eddf03f1ddaf9d9d196344ba91a58b8e" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Humanitarian Action and Response</unittitle><unitid>UA197.019</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2000/2004" type="inclusive">2000 -- 2004</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_638887db140205e7b7210c5efd1371b9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Humanitarian Action and Response project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_933fa9c9f39da823981a8787f638f9bc"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_51324e0bfe19cea950706f845296befc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_0253c6e64dab4294d1941995897c9004" level="item"><did><unittitle>Mapping the future capacities of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</unittitle><unitid>UA197.019.019.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2004-03-26/2004-03-26">2004-03-26</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_25aa13a57ca52d39d6bd2c00de3387ec"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_23f748942ece01ebd54c6c5c76760972"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Norwegian Red Cross, a member of the IFRC, has contacted the Feinstein Famine Center, asking it to lead a dedicated research process to propose areas where National Societies' special skills and strengths might be further utilised within the framework of the Federation, to suggest new modes of cooperation within the Federation, to analyze the cost benefits of providing certain key Federal services through individual members or small consortia, and finally to look at new modalities for financing, staffing and managing Federation national and regional delegations.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><subject source="local">Red Cross and Red Crescent</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_84faeb7adb4cfe532d8c021c7ce70889" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Famine in North Korea: Humanitarian Responses in Communist Nations</unittitle><unitid>UA197.019.019.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lautze, Sue</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2000-02-07/2000-02-07">2000-02-07</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a273298a831c63960ea2fb2ffd7e2d90"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_93e5b4796b673e330448346d62e1a466"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This issues paper is intended to raise awareness and encourage debate about the current crisis in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

Prior to the Second World War, conflict victims were predominantly found between "established fighting units such as government military troops and armed opposition groups."1 Today, however, conflicts inflict their greatest harm on civilian populations, 80% of whom are women and children. In the 1990s alone, civilian populations endured nearly 90% of the casualties resulting from war representing a sharp increase from approximately 5% in the 1930s only 60 years prior.2 The practice of civilian targeting has resulted in mass population movements, or forcible displacement, on a scale previously unknown. In 1999, an estimated 7 million people were driven from their homes by war, civil insurgency or political repression, which "increased the world's uprooted population to 35 million, 14 million of which were refugees."3 This has taken a huge physical
        and psychological toll on war-affected individuals and their societies.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Conflict, Armed (War)</subject><subject source="local">Psychotherapy</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_1c330b0814fbe70ed7542fcbfe3dbd95" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>M.A. in Humanitarian Assistance</unittitle><unitid>UA197.020</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2003/2003" type="inclusive">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_75bad188e7b0c4d66e8627be8a1eb6bb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the M.A. in Humanitarian Assistance project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f86ae58f9a4f1bfb5f08d555b612fccd"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_3301bc45405fe45d5e7afeb4c30018ea"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_8ae277ea307823471b5bcc4cc17cf7e7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards a New Curriculum for Humanitarian Studies?

However, underlying malnutrition continues to impede positive health outcomes, and HIV infection in turn worsens malnutrition. The Ethiopia Food by Prescription (FBP) program, implemented by Save the Children US (SC US), USAID/Ethiopia, and the Ethiopian Ministry of Health
                since 2010, provides therapeutic food along with nutritional assessment and counseling to malnourished HIV+ individuals. The Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy was contracted by SC US to research the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this intervention, in order to contribute much needed evidence to guide programming and policy, both in Ethiopia and worldwide.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_62af5bdc162aa44c132a5f5d2484e118"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><geogname source="local">Ethiopia</geogname><subject source="local">Malnutrition</subject><subject source="local">HIV</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_7b5f976741c0c2d0edbcbadcf2775096" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Refugee Livelihoods in Urban Areas</unittitle><unitid>UA197.026</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 Digital Object(s)</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2013/2013" type="inclusive">2013</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_afaffa801a4f29000909196ce0cf99bd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series contains reports related to the Refugee Livelihoods in Urban Areas project.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_d3ca5c939248f47e84036d1c3052656e"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in the order documents were received.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_00b392061032f7411045b620859b6bca"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><c id="aspace_7cfb1537d5f79eed48468d5f984557ad" level="item"><did><unittitle> Refugee Livelihoods in Urban Areas: Case Study Israel </unittitle><unitid>UA197.026.026.00001</unitid><unitdate normal="2013-02-01/2013-02-01">2013-02-01</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d50597c549e5b905b22d002f364a9a6a">Refugees in urban areas face a specific set of livelihoods problems, and in recent years many aid agencies have begun to try to address these problems by supporting refugees through vocational training, microcredit and other services.

First, how do decision makers in the humanitarian sector currently use information and analysis? Second, what factors, other than information and analysis, are influential in making decisions? Third, what would enable better-informed response decisions? In order to address these overarching questions, the study looks first at some of the main processes of decision-making in the humanitarian sector and the factors that appear
                to have most influence on decisions of different kinds. It goes on to look at the way information and analysis is currently generated in the humanitarian sector—both through formal and informal means—and related questions of relevance and credibility. These two topics are then brought together in addressing the question of the use of information by decision makers, and what might enable more informed and evidence-based response decisions.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f952b7b7da6f37e049b262d1b79599c7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><controlaccess><subject source="local">Evidence-based practice in social work</subject><subject source="local">Humanitarian Assistance</subject><corpname source="local">Feinstein International Center</corpname></controlaccess></c></c><c id="aspace_21da38d1c450b5fd1dab7ce471b3c883" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>People First!

This recognition of the bonds that tie the living to the dead has become a key feature of international human rights, encapsulated in the United Nations' Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law.
                But in the case of mass killings and mass graves, there may be no consensus on what "proper treatment" of the dead entails. Drawing on interviews conducted in 2011 with survivors and leaders from Barlonyo, Uganda – the site of a large-scale massacre perpetrated by the Lord's Resistance Army in 2004 – this report analyzes how rapid cultural transformations have complicated what proper treatment of the dead entails, and, therefore, the right to satisfaction. By paying careful
                attention to how death and remembrance rituals have changed over time among the Langi, the report sets out to provide a set of recommendations based on community priorities for the treatment of those who have died as a result of mass violence; and, offer insights into the cultural context in which any future programming around the proper treatment and memorialization of those killed would be undertaken.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_28a69c8cc734f5f53d58258b831e8723"><head>Conditions
