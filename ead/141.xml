<p>All folder labels were re-stapled.  When a folder label had fallen off and were located in the folder/box, we reattached the label.  If a label was missing, the donor's name was used as new title.
Some folders were in poor condition and had to be replaced.  Original labels were maintained, including information on the front panel or inside panel of the folder.  Letter-size folders containing legal-size documents were replaced with legal-size folders. Minor alphabetization errors were corrected. Processed by Liz Chrastil, July25-August 8, 2006. </p><p>Boxes 25-30 were processed in September - October 2013 by Lydia P under supervision of Erin Faulder and Eliot Wilczek. </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Office of Estate and Gift Planning launched in 1993, though the functions of the Office had existed informally within University Advancement for decades prior. It was originally headed by Thomas B. Hunt, the Office's Senior Director. It changed its name in 2003 to the Gift Planning Office. The Office works with donors to coordinate planned gifts to Tufts, assisting with affairs such as negotiating a will or living trust, or setting up a charitable remainder annuity trust. Additionally, the office is closely coordinated with the Charles Tufts Society and the Austin B. Fletcher Society, groups where membership is awarded after the inclusion of Tufts University or the Fletcher School in one's estate plans. As of 2020, the Office has separate coordinators for several of the schools within the university, such as the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Medicine, and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p>  </bioghist>
