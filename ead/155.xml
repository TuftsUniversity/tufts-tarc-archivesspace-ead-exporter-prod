    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>In 1972 the Tufts Gay Community (TGC) organization was formed to provide a space for gay and bisexual people to meet and support one another and to educate the university community about gay related issues.  Although the term "lesbian" was not included in the group name until 1981, the TGC's goal was to shed light on the issues facing the gay and lesbian community on campus.  In 1980 the TGC established the first "drop-in center" on campus in Curtis Hall.  By October 1987, the drop-in center was moved to Hayes House and In September of 1988, Donna Penn was hired as the first coordinator to increase programming and support services.</p><p>In 1992, with support from students, faculty and staff, Dean B. Knable established the first Lesbian Gay and Bisexual (LGB) Resource Center at Tufts in Lewis Hall and Heather Wishik replaced Donna Penn as administrator.  After the holding of the first Pride on the Hill event in November 1992, the Center underwent a number of staff changes in the mid-1990s.  This included the hiring of the first full-time director, Judith Brown in 1997.</p><p>In September 1998, the Tufts Rainbow House was established to provide safe housing for LGBT people on campus in light of the high number of bias incidents that occurred in residence halls.  In January 2003 Dona Yarbrough was hired as the LGBT Center Director and began to push for a housing policy that would accommodate transgender students at Tufts.  In the fall of 2004, Yarbrough's Transgender Housing Policy was adopted by Residential Life and the Center also began organizing its Queer Peer mentoring program. Upon the suggestion of Yarbrough, the administration accepted a revision to Tufts University non-discrimination policy by adding gender identity and expression in the fall of 2005. From 1997 until the present, the LGBT Center has organized annual and statewide Safe Colleges Conferences, originally called "Sound Mind, Sound Body, Sound Off."  The conferences include a keynote speaker and workshops created by staff and organizations, both from campus and off-campus.</p><p>Under the umbrella of the Dean of Students, the LGBT Center is part of the Group of Six, which includes: Women's Center, Africana Center, Latino Center, Asian American Center, and the International Center.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was processed in spring of 2014 by Dan Bullman under the supervision of Susanne Belovari, Archivist for Reference and Collections.  Materials were rehoused in archival boxes.  Because materials were not arranged in any decipherable original order, we arranged materials in two series and alphabetically within each series.  Folder titles added by archives staff are in brackets [].</p><p>Web sites were crawled by Archive-It. Web crawl information updated in finding aid annually. </p><p>As of March 2014, all digital material in the collection is awaiting processing because DCA is currently writing processing policies for using Bagit. The material will become series three.</p><p>A CD by the International Center regarding International Host Advisor Training was moved to UA088 (International Center records).  Physical discs (largely CD-Rs and CD-RWs) were removed from the collection, preserved for two years following stabilization in the Records Archivist office and then destroyed.</p><p>Photographs in old photo albums were removed and rehoused in folders, original labels were maintained. Some generic rally and promotional posters, a banner, were returned to the Center. A large poster board for the Safe Colleges Conference depicting various LGBT services and activism at Tufts was photographed; items were pulled off the board, put in folders, labeled and included in series two. Then the poster board was discarded.  The collection includes slides copyrighted by photographer Keitaro Yoshioka which therefore remain restricted and unprocessed.</p><p>Processing of the 2018 accessions was completed by Leah Edelman and Jady Zhang in 2018-2019. Materials were placed in archival boxes if the original housing was damaged, and loose materials were placed in folders where needed. Received order was maintained. A file-level inventory and series-level description were created and the finding aid was updated at the time of processing.  </p>  </processinfo>

Contains office records, photographs, event information, newspaper clippings, newsletters, digital objects, and educational materials.  The bulk of the material spans from 1989-2007.  Materials from Tufts faculty members Jonathan Strong and Jeanne Penvenne related to the LGBT Faculty Staff Caucus were incorporated into this series.  The office files provide a window into LGBT rights activism and events held at Tufts.  There are records and newspaper articles documenting the students' opposition in the early 2000s to actions taken by the Tufts Christian Fellowship to prevent a lesbian student member from taking a leadership position in their organization.  This series also contains research files compiled during the Summer Scholars award that led to the creation of the Tufts Queer History Project website by Tufts student Elena Mead.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_717cc20a64e9f67b868fc07f6251364e"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged alphabetically by folder title.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict

The TQHP website sought to document the history of the LGBT community at Tufts from the late 1960s into the 2000s.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_cdcc2f32ed6119644041199eea164ab8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Film Archive</unittitle><unitid>UA188-026</unitid><unitdate normal="2007-08/2007-08">2007-08</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4d7634a0c21543b7bb8f411025f433b2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_121232493d63f64a77095f4cafa79e76" level="file"><did><unittitle>GI Joe</unittitle><unitid>UA188-027</unitid><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3cbd9b92facbc6eca442469c556e5476"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>20 years from date of creation.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="aspace_bcbcfdd52dfd3ed5cc7c3ac0e756bc5f" level="file"><did><unittitle> Tufts Students Against Discrimination (TSAD) files</unittitle><unitid>UA188-028</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Center</corpname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Barry, Dan</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2000/2000">2000</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_95008c3261c070fadeecc3d7c9fc6e70"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>20 years from date of creation.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3a48697af66f8451b483069cda66b814"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In response to the homophobia claim that was made in April 2000 as well as the unsuccessful attempt to change the non-discrimination policy, a group called Tufts Students Against Discrimination (TSAD) was formed to fight against discrimination at Tufts. In the beginning of fall of 2000, the students organized a sit-in at the Tufts Admissions Building, called Bendetson Hall. They took over the building until the language in the non-discrimination policy better fit the needs of all students regardless of their belief system. The action was successful and very visible. The students took over the building for two days and one night and were met by significant administrative action on revising the policy.The folder named "TSAD" contains all the digital documents pertaining to the TSAD movement and sit-in, except for the aforementioned two.The folder named "TSAD Archive Scans" contains Dan Barry's scans of physical documents from that time, including flyers from campus and newspaper clippings. The folder named "E-mail" is as complete a record as Dan could generate of the correspondence between TSAD members, including messages on the group's Listserv and personal, TSAD-related correspondence that Dan was involved in.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d7b9044ad6b90ad2b3862910e715a3ea" level="item"><did><unittitle>TSAD oral history interview with Dan Barry</unittitle><unitid>UA188-029</unitid><unitdate certainty="approximate" normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_08bf7b4ecaeae48839c2da11b4af0eb6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_dceb30de30350153c927d0776fc9d8d4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This digital object contains a video of a Tufts Students Against Discrimination (TSAD) oral history interview with Tufts graduate, Dan Barry.
