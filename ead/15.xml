    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA) was established in 1876 when the Trustees of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) set aside rooms for an art school in the newly opened Copley Square building. Originally called the School of Painting and Drawing, in 1901 it was fully incorporated into the museum and renamed the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, sometimes called the Boston Museum School or simply the Museum School. In 1945, the SMFA and Tufts College began their partnership with a teacher training program. Additional programs and partnerships soon followed and in July 2016, the SMFA officially became part of Tufts University's School of Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>In 1876 the School of Painting and Drawing was established at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in the new Copley Square building. Eight students were enrolled in 1877 and by 1879 the school had a total of 160 students, the majority of them women. Also in 1879, the Art Student Association was founded by students from the school; the Association later changed its name to The Copley Society which still operates today as the oldest non-profit art association in the nation.  The Museum of Fine Arts moved in 1909 to a new location on Huntington Avenue and the school moved with it.  In 1927, the school moved out of its buildings on the Museum of Fine Arts lot into the building designed by Guy Lowell at 230 The Fenway. </p>

<p>The School of the Museum of Fine Arts offered courses in drawing, graphic arts, painting, sculpture, ceramics, jewelry, silversmithing, and commercial art. The curriculum was traditional, with foundation courses required in the first two years of the program.  In 1968, however, faculty hierarchies were eliminated, all students had access to all courses, and the review board system (student artwork is judged at the end of the term by a board of staff and students, in place of grades) was put in place.  More recently, the curriculum has expanded to include photography, video arts, and performance art. The school trained many well-known artists, including Cy Twombley (1928-2011), Jim Dine (1935-), and Ellsworth Kelly (1923-2015). </p>

<p>The relationship between Tufts College and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, or the "Museum School," began in the 1943-1944 academic year when School of the Museum of Fine Arts Professor Russell T. Smith began to teach part-time at Tufts.  In 1945, Tufts College of Special Studies and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts began a partnership which allowed students at Tufts to take electives in creative arts at the Museum School, and Museum School students to take education courses to be certified to teach art.  The partnership was part of a larger effort to provide opportunities to students outside of the Tufts College campuses. The School of the Museum of Fine Arts was not accredited to give out degrees and instead granted diplomas and certificates while the Bachelor of Science in Education was conferred by Tufts College.  The partnership expanded over the years and students from the Museum School were granted master's as well as bachelor's degrees from Tufts University.</p>

<p>In July 2016, the SMFA officially became part of Tufts University's School of Arts and Sciences. The SMFA now offers both undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as a 5-year dual-degree program (BA/BS and BFA).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>Tufts University acquired the School of the Museum of Fine Arts on July 1, 2016, after a 70-year partnership with the School on a joint dual-degree program. DCA staff were not able to survey records or discuss records with SMFA staff while negotiations for this aquisition were underway. When DCA staff arrived at the SMFA the week before the acquisition, most SMFA staff had already left the School, leaving behind a subset of records in boxes and filing cabinets. That summer DCA staff selected and packed additional records in consultation with the remaining (or new) staff from Academic Affairs, Communication and Marketing, Development, Exhibitions and Public Programs, and the Library. These records were received at DCA in September, 2016, and a second transfer from the Library was received in November, 2016. Records in Series 5 were maintained in SMFA's Student Services file room in the Mission Hill building until a July 2017 digitization project. Digiscribe New England scanned all transcripts and Review Board comments at their Norwood, MA facility, July-November 2017. On February 13, 2018 the records were transferred from the Digiscribe facility to DCA's off-site storage at Iron Mountain, under the supervision of Liz Francis, University Records Manager. Custody of the records was transferred to DCA by JoAnn Jack, Registrar, ASE later that week. Records in Series 14 were previously transferred from the SMFA to the Museum of Fine Arts Archives and were then transferred to DCA in August 2019.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Preliminary processing of the 2016, 2017, and 2018 accessions was completed by Leah Edelman in 2017-2018. Materials were placed in archival boxes if the original housing was damaged. Received order was maintained. A box-level inventory and series-level description were created and the finding aid was updated at the time of preliminary processing. Boxes of student records from accession UA-2018-030 were inventoried at Digiscribe New England (Norwood, MA); Leah Edelman uploaded this inventory, created a series level description, and updated the finding aid. Due to rehousing in preparation for a move of media to offsite storage, materials were consolidated and boxes 75 and 79 removed.  </p><p>The September 2016 accession was processed by Archives and Research Assistant Rose Koven under the supervision of Collections Management Archivist Adrienne Pruitt in Fall 2018. Loose materials and those materials in damaged original folders were placed in archival folders. Original folder titles were maintained where applicable, and materials were kept in the groupings and order in which they were received when possible. Materials were placed into series at the box level, and boxes were consolidated when appropriate. Loose admissions catalogs, course catalogs, exhibition catalogs, and publications were placed in the appropriate series. Duplicate and out of scope publications, non-permanent administration records, software training manuals, and promotional items such as stickers and luggage tags were deaccessioned.  Folders of slides of artwork from series 7: Development were temporarily separated and treated for active mold.</p><p>During the Fall 2018 processing of the collection, materials were consolidated, resulting in boxes 55, 57, 62, and 66 being removed from the collection.  Box numbering is therefore discontinuous.</p><p>Processing of the 2019 accession was completed by Archives and Research Assistant Allison Maier in Fall 2019, and was continued by Archives and Research Assistant Vanessa Formato in Spring 2020. A box-level inventory as well as series-level description were created by Records and Accessioning Archivist Jane Kelly and the finding aid was updated at the time of processing. During the Fall 2019 processing of the collection, materials were consolidated, resulting in boxes 490, 503, 528, 536, and 542 being removed from the collection. Box numbering is discontinuous.</p>  </processinfo>

The first set of student records date roughly from 1876 to 1930 and are index cards housed in wooden card catalog drawers, with numbers on each card corresponding to a page number in the registration ledgers housed in the box labeled "Register of pupils."  Also in the wooden card catalog drawers are an index to the scrapbooks found on microfilm, and an index to early administration and committee meetings. The second set of student records date roughly from 1930 to 1957 and contain the actual registration card, usually with a photograph attached. The chronological dividing line of 1930 isn't exact; registration methods changed during the period coinciding with the move to the building at 230 The Fenway in 1928.</p><p>Early SMFA records include Annual Reports, course catalogs, and correspondence. </p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_3aa27f42344e89be98078f27e4cb4bc8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>This sub-series contains some restricted material.

Administrative records from several SMFA deans date from the 1930s to 2013. The majority of materials are from Deborah Haigh Dluhy's tenure (1993 – 2010) and include reports, correspondence, meeting materials, budgets, proposals, self-study materials for the SMFA, and materials relating to the Board of Governors. 
Capital campaign records relate mostly to fundraising in the 1980s and 1990s. This includes reports, meeting minutes, directories of and notes concerning potential donors, and donor research material. It also includes materials relating to events, such as guest lists, invoices, program schedules, and invitations.
Course programs and catalogs date from 1900 – 2015. Alongside this material are advertisements about exhibitions and publications from the school, including an independent paper, "the Underground" and a publication by Graham Harwood titled "if comix Mental."
</p>

<p>Records of the SMFA Self-Study for National Association of Schools of Art and Design consist of administrative documents such as internal reports, reports from other art schools, correspondence, mission statements, operating procedures, and newspaper clippings about the school dating from 2004 – 2010.</p>

<p>Records of the SMFA's Massachusetts Department of Higher Education degree granting application and approval includes materials regarding the Program Application for New Degrees, which the SMFA submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education circa 2012. This application was part of the accreditation process the SMFA underwent in order to be able to offer the degrees of Bachelor of Fine Arts in Studio Art, Master of Fine Arts in Studio Art, and Honorary Doctorate of Fine Art.</p>

<p>The bulk of the scrapbooks dating from 1878 to 1990 contain clippings, postcards, pamphlets, invitations, and photographs related to SMFA students and faculty and their artwork and exhibitions. Grand Tour scrapbooks dating from 1904 to 1913 and the Mary Hallowell Loud scrapbook dating from 1905 contain captioned postcards and photographs, tickets, itineraries, and narrative descriptions of artwork, museums, and travel across Europe. The personal scrapbook dating from 1910 to 1923 contains captioned photographs of family, friends, and classmates at the SMFA during this period.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_05389069af488477d362d4af12510185"><head>Processing Information</head><p>Processing of the 2019 accession was begun by Archives and Research Assistant Allison Maier in Fall 2019, and was continued by Archives and Research Assistant Vanessa Formato in Spring 2020.
