    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy was established in 1933 by a bequest from Austin Barclay Fletcher, late president of the Board of Trustees and lifetime benefactor of Tufts. Fletcher's gift of $1,000,000 was intended to finance a school of law and diplomacy, but it was nearly ten years after his death before the Fletcher School opened its doors. When it did so, in the midst of the Great Depression and with the collaboration of Harvard University, the Fletcher School became the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States.</p>
<p>As envisioned by Fletcher and President Cousens, the Fletcher School was to have occupied a new building on the Medford Campus, situated next to Miner Hall. However, as the financial uncertainties brought on by the Depression increased, it was decided to open the school in the old Goddard Gymnasium instead, with the understanding that dramatic renovations would be made to make the building habitable. Classroom and office space was provided in the building, but the focus of the renovations was to provide a home for the school's library. In 1964, Mugar Hall was built adjacent to Goddard Hall to provide additional office space and dining facilities for Fletcher students. In 1981 the Cabot Intercultural Center was added to the complex, linking Goddard and Mugar Halls. The Cabot Center provided a large auditorium and seven floors of offices for faculty and administrators of the school.</p>
<p>The library of the Fletcher School was one of the thorniest problems presented to the school's founders. The books, serials, and other publications deemed necessary to support the curriculum of a school such as Fletcher were absent from the college library and to acquire them would have constituted a major expense at a time when finances were extraordinarily tight. Problems over how to manage the library contributed to the delayed opening of the school. After several years of discussions and negotiations, a solution was presented in 1933 when the World Peace Foundation, at the prompting of Fletcher's Acting Dean Hoskins and thanks to groundwork laid by President Cousens, offered to donate its library of 40,000 volumes to the institution to form the basis for a suitable collection. In subsequent years the Foundation maintained many of the periodical subscriptions essential to the collection.</p>
<p>Harvard's involvement with the Fletcher School began in the planning stages, when Tufts President John Cousens opened discussions with several individuals at Harvard in 1930 concerning the proposed school. Roscoe Pound, dean of the Harvard Law School, was sufficiently intrigued by the possibilities to bring the plan to the attention of the president of Harvard. Cooperation between Harvard and Tufts in the development of Fletcher was seen to bring assets to both institutions, and in 1932, a plan was developed by which Tufts and Harvard would manage Fletcher. According to this agreement, a Joint Executive Committee was formed with members from Tufts and Harvard, and professors were to be chosen from the faculties of both institutions. The deanship of the Fletcher School was to be held by Tufts and the school was to be located on the Medford Campus. This agreement ultimately served as the basis on which the Fletcher School was built. However, within a short time the agreement was under discussion again as Harvard registered objections to the manner in which administration of the school had evolved. A revised agreement signed in 1934 reworked the participation of Harvard in the administration of the school and was the foundation for the duration of Harvard's involvement with Fletcher. As a result of this agreement, Fletcher was officially known as "The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, administered by Tufts College, with the cooperation of Harvard University."</p>
<p>While initially conceived to offer a Ph. D. degree in addition to a masters degree, it was quickly apparent that the new school would not be able to offer the resources necessary to support such a program. Instead, students were offered the choice of obtaining either a Master of Arts degree after one year of study or the specially designed Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy (MALD) after two years of study and successful completion of a thesis and examination by the faculty. Students chose to concentrate in either Public and International Law, Diplomacy and International Relations, or International Economics. The focus was to be on preparing students for foreign service or international business, and to that end, the school sought to build a small student body of exceptionally qualified students. Twenty-one students entered Fletcher in October 1933, all with bachelor's degrees and four already holding a master's. They were expected to have reading knowledge of French or German - if not both - and a thorough grounding in history, government, and economics.</p>
<p>Faculty staffing was an ongoing issue in the early years of the school. As initially conceived, Fletcher was to have a full-time resident faculty supplemented by adjuncts from Tufts and Harvard. However, it initially proved to be a difficult task to attract faculty of sufficient caliber at the salaries that Fletcher was able to offer. The first full-time faculty member, Dr. Norman J. Padelford, professor of International Law and Organization, was not appointed until 1936-37.</p>
<p>Housing for Fletcher students was acquired in 1936 with the purchase of Wilson House on Winthrop Street. In 1939 Blakeslee House, on Curtis Street, was added to house women students at Fletcher. Both houses were named for original members of the Fletcher faculty. In the early 1960s Fletcher was given Fletcher Hall to use as a dormitory for its students, and Wilson House and Blakeslee House were returned to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>After World War II, Fletcher instituted specialized training programs for career diplomats in other countries. The first such program was in 1949, for the diplomatic corps of newly independent Pakistan. Since then, programs have been run for groups from Kuwait, Qatar, and others.</p>
<p>When student protests against the United States' involvement in Vietnam and the presence of ROTC and in-service training officers on campus and particularly the Fletcher School reached a peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Fletcher became the focus of student anger. Dean Guillon of the Fletcher School was an outspoken supporter of the US role in Vietnam and the presence of military personnel on campus, prompting student outrage. In 1970 students firebombed Dean Guillon's office in Mugar Hall, causing an estimated $70,000 in damage. </p>
<p>In 1973-74 a combined degree program with the was instituted in which highly qualified undergraduates would be admitted at the end of the Junior year to work toward both the B.A. and the Fletcher M.A. Because Fletcher's student body has traditionally been made up of students with experience in the field, either in diplomatic service or international business, as well as grounding in multiple foreign languages, very few undergraduates have been admitted to the program.</p>	
<p>As of 2005, Fletcher enrolls an average of 350 students per year, from the United States and more than seventy countries around the world. Students choose from fields of study including Public International Law, International Organizations, International Business and Economic Law, Law and Development, United States, Europe, Asia, Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization, International Information and Communication, International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution, International Trade and Commercial Policies, International Monetary Theory and Policy, Development Economics, International Environment and Resource Policy, International Technology Policy and Management, Political Systems and Theories, International Security Studies, Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis, International Political Economy, and International Business Relations.</p>  </bioghist>

Concomitantly, within countries seeking funding, actions of the IMF are often used by interest groups and parties for political purposes. John R.

This is particularly true for antitrust regulation of joint ventures abroad, despite efforts by the Justice Department to clarify the law as it endeavors to enforce it.

However, he quickly became disillusioned with that cause and eventually was arrested in 1975 for refusing to serve on a government finance committee.

As a Research Fellow at the Fletcher School, he is presently completing another book entitled, Vietnam: Neither Peace nor Honor.

By its nature, a crisis involves some higher degree of risk; it imposes on crisis managers the necessity of defining goals and making rapid decisions in a short period of time, often based on incomplete information. In this article, Brad Michael Meslin bases his analysis of U.S. crisis management during the Iranian crisis on the cognitive/cybernetic model developed by John Steinbruner. Meslin concludes with the suggestion that U.S. crisis management in the future, because of the changes in the world environment and relative U.S. power and influence, will have to rely on a more intimate knowledge and understanding of other peoples if it is to be successful.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b5bcfc2d3acb8d1f563d925e2a3a79e6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_540298804fc9a1197c79cd03a6e6afe7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_9c7a382fc4b1ec57541d1540f7e93df8"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>5, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_7fd29f8202bde0e4e7ec802dd398acd5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Parallels in Isolation: Managing Space Problems in Antarctica</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00010.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Harding, Peter X.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1981/1981">1981</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f028e1b0ae76e72cfd8be9dc6159f7de">As more time is spent in the exploration and inhabitation of space, periods of isolation will grow longer, accompanied by unique forms of stress for individuals functioning in an artificial environment.

While its medieval political and social structure grapples with modernization and the pressures of a vast accumulation of petrodollars, Saudi Arabia remains a critical element in American policy in the Middle East. In light of the ruthless invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union and the Muslim fratricide of the Iran-Iraq war, the stability and longevity of the Saud family and the kingdom they rule have become more important - and problematic. In the following essay, Lincoln Bloomfield, Jr., presents a penetrating analysis of some of the internal and external pressures on Saudi Arabia, its princes, and the Washington-Moscow-Riyadh axes of tension and influence.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a92dd4c0574758c92967a2cf05aa37d6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e2a61e1de497ebd47a25826fb5dbf2ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_885d033380668a12a5b5dcefff6fd82a"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>5, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_97561c6bd93c31fe082631527220515d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Hegel, Freedom and the Ideological Roots of Soviet Foreign Policy</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00010.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lukes, Igor</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1981/1981">1981</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d5a699bbd4c831f1288ebe004e72a8be">In the preface to the Science of Logic, Hegel wrote, "If it is remarkable when a nation loses its constitutional theory ... it is certainly no less remarkable when a nation loses its metaphysics." In this article, Mr. Lukes examines the Hegelian notion of freedom and traces its development in the writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Lukzcs. He concludes that the Hegelian idea of freedom became adulterated as it passed from one thinker to another, and that it no longer provides the metaphysical foundation for present day Soviet politics. Because the Soviet ideology has lost this fundamental underpinning, it no longer designs its foreign policy with the idea of freedom in mind.</abstract><langmaterial><language

The Honorable Robert E. White, who has held many diplomatic posts including Deputy United States Representative to the Organization of American States, U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay, and, until the beginning of this year, U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, agreed to talk to The Forum about El Salvador and current U.S. policy toward that country. This interview complements the Hars-Espinosa study which appears on pp. 295-319 of this issue. Ambassador White defines U.S. objectives in El Salvador and argues that any imposed solution to the present crisis which does not take cognizance of the political realities in El Salvador and which is not founded on the moral element of foreign policy which the American people demand, will only exacerbate the conflict. Mr. White graduated from The Fletcher School in 1954 and is presently Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_79f27e8f2481ed1ba0c401fc18ff966c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c9391f34f86f4ade6d3a6f7e6c23ea87"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_9d6e761503232904e418a3387a0861ca"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>5, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_b33639181606e72971b53ac0ff6a324b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Book Review</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00010.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Henrikson, Alan K. </persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Deese, David D.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nye, Joseph S.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Smith, GerardWich, Robert</corpname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Perry, John Curtis</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1981/1981">1981</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8adf487a07aecea1cadc23ffdf10fe38">Book Review</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_eecfa1f8c9855786f33c7dd22f328631"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a878d37b389ef063504971e9c904ac10"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer.

At the center of the debate are the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile and NATO's 1979 decision to modernize its theater nuclear force. In this article, Jeff McCausland examines the major factor that influenced NATO's decision to deploy the new missiles - and seeks to determine Soviet aims by analyzing contemporary Soviet military doctrine and the capabilities of the SS-20 missile. Building on this analysis, he discusses the missile's potential as a military, and political weapon, its proposed targets, and its place in the future of arms control negotiations. McCausland concludes that closer examination of Soviet intentions, actions and capabilities can clarify the issues facing the West.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d0213f2d43b81df095e0404a467ff23f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_2b1dec3b5de827f244b1c583f6ccfcaf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_9ccbc8ea3795ef6bc647a258893f44eb"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_33803f2d2eddd065194ec181bd270f4a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Chile Under Frei: The Alliance for Progress</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00011.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sands, David R. </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5a6fd1fca31770799aa254ef9b298166">Richard Nixon's image of the United States as a "pitiful, helpless giant" illustrates the paradox of a great power frustrated by its limited ability to control events abroad. In this article, David R. Sands looks at one case in which, despite extensive American aid to a liberal, progressive regime in a traditional ally, US interests suffered a major setback. Eduardo Frei Montalva and his progressive Christian Democratic Party received great material and moral aid from US administrators during the years of the Alliance for Progress. But American policymakers misunderstood both the complexities of Chilean politics and the enormous stake of private US commercial interests in Latin America. The end result was the decisive defeat of Frei's party in 1970 and the election of Salvador Allende.

The United Nations has maintained a peacekeeping force in the troubled Kashmir region between Pakistan and India for more than thirty years. In this article, Shahidul Alam uses this long-standing dispute to illustrate the problems encountered by United Nations in promoting the resolution of international disputes. He concludes that the United Nations' use of peacekeeping forces to police cease-fires may actually prolong, rather than speed, the ultimate resolution of conflict.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d2a83c946f98871695c8ae78a2c854dc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_f0312b0228e5aa7e9261d2977e586a65"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_c69294748c8592e59f575ef9c566e917"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_072f95e749598a7ae5d383a659feefeb" level="item"><did><unittitle>Observations on the Role of Services in International Trade</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00011.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Livingston, Susan C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3a98adc0f7809b8c9a174acf3dcacfb8">Most international economists recognize the large and increasingly important role of services in international trade, but they often fail to account for services in international models of trade. In this article Susan Livingston analyzes the difficulties encountered in defining "invisible" good in international trade. She first examines practical and theoretical attempts by economists and political authorities to define services. She then explores international trade in services and the barriers nations have erected to inhibit it. As an example of trade in services, she discusses the insurance industry and the problems it has experienced as a representative service offering agent in the international market. The article concludes with suggestions for the use of several international policy forums to discuss service industry problems and to liberalize trade.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cf931f0d8d6e1e632ea73e2ebefc784a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_328e3cc44ab8311ba759e571e25f1100"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_57d77b05f6f5016bc1376887549ce9f5"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_c3b39439bcc47d3b4bc0867d2b4d54df" level="item"><did><unittitle>Solidarity and Poland's Turmoil: Anatomy of a Movement, Origins of a Revolution</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00011.00007</unitid><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ec2962c8c7f03f62e0e5fee4cf31f451"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_166962ce4f7083397f7b9147561f4dfe"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_320e6df59414306313cd29fc8f8f60e5"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_3afb196bd89f2e09a6d355c44c7f173c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Is Poland Not Yet Lost?</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00011.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Griffith, William E. </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bc186bad0393bec16b85519273d42997"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_0e16356befa8609f71ca2d9148894db0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_ee04a38d39632bb25b6c39350fcc2eb5"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_86647cbd080ce352adcf41d3e0ec4f84" level="item"><did><unittitle>Inside Solidarity: An Interview with Ewa-Teresa Eliasz Brantley </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00011.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brantley, Ewa-Teresa Eliasz </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_07cdb0a8ca6ac9df02831ba0ef2651ae">The nature of the independent trade union movement in Poland was the major topic of discussion at Solidarity's first National Congress in September 1981. Ewa-Teresa Eliasz Brantley was present at that Congress as one of the drafters of the statute defining Solidarity and its role in Polish society. She spoke with The Forum about the statute and its implications for Solidarity's future, as well as the historical development of the trade union movement. Her remarks also dealt with the question of Solidarity�s perceptions of itself as a union and as a political force.

In the United States experts have written extensively on every aspect of those shocks as they have affected the United States, but little attention has focused on the energy security problems facing America's allies. In this article, Allen D. Jebsen examines the energy security problems and strategies of France and West Germany. Beginning with the historical context of the world-wide energy security threat, Jebsen goes on to describe the roles West Germany and France have played in controlling the domestic oil industry, redirecting domestic energy consumption, and generally reducing vulnerability to oil shocks. Among his findings is evidence that the political systems of both France and West Germany hinder the development of efficient energy security policies. Jebsen then explores the foreign policy remedies taken by France and West Germany in response to their energy problems. His conclusions, based on the full spectrum of domestic and international concerns of each country, indicate that both countries have serious reason to view their policies to date as inadequate.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6623544c2750f0db0e0260f92e61bbe6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_faa41745656755622cce759d9f58584b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_a6252b43d2a539a82b0f7c10e5830599"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_2d96f669e8d8061939dd8b8dc6f22fbd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Aftermath of the Saur Coup: Insurgency and Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00012.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cynkin, Thomas M. </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ae970274b5538c41e73443d83117e2e6">When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the attention of the world was focused on this arid mountainous country, strategically situated between Pakistan and Iran.

Indeed, a strictly economic approach to such matters can often lead to unintended, deleterious consequences for a country. In this article, Dan Grosz analyzes the development and repercussions of one such instance - the Turkish debt troubles of the 1970s and early 1980s. He demonstrates that a proper understanding of a nation's financial health requires more than a familiarity with numbers. It requires also a proper sensitivity to basic political and social forces.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_851bd6d5575d3afe120f705449078e97"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c57ade2f870b41eaf24ac0024d697d9f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_40be07f1bebee918cb06d288d5733fcc"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_5e1b34838dc0c6356388be85ac4726f8" level="item"><did><unittitle>ASEAN: Contributor to Stability and Development</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00012.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Shafie, H.

Mr. Nakagawa explains that much of the ill-feeling on this side of the Pacific results from American misperceptions of the Japanese position in the world trade and the impatience of American companies trying to penetrate Japanese markets. He concludes that there is much room for negotiations between the two nations, but warns that constructive action will only be hindered if the Japanese-American Trade relations become a political issue in the United States.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9443e35327b6f4f025c536c2bb6e1a7f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9c7654e6237d6d09c3ddb3b5886d0e2a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_abe912ee94e04464cf7452a7b11136aa"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_f60863789b8261c0e873e66afa702f57" level="item"><did><unittitle>Three Challenges for Better International Monetary Management</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00012.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cohen, Benjamin J. </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fbc8a17b4785067331b80622425a9cdb"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_afdeec7c4f1e498f6e43b05d1b774566"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_bf6ac5b0cbe97b088fc90546ff3312ea"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_77ebf14bd194c6eb0be190fd02d01ae9" level="item"><did><unittitle>Germany After Schmidt: The Origins and Implications of Foreign Policy under a CDU/CSU Government</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00012.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Clemens, Clayton M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2d73314b137112d34989022555016580"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5d10010f51a7a0e9bb6cecfdd830e39b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_c4e636ead7b3fbcd934a455b1f034339"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_3d2d6bbf32c1d8d6224f35b96779717e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Ore Wars: The Problem of U.S. Dependence of Foreign Materials</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00012.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Orme, John</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ffdab353ac3869cd0508c63e3ec7010e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_cea121c6c9950e93bc37538e239a270a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_bd74ac37cfbe46f60cb952598addd2d9"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_b809f7e460974e8bf6295d14e29fc229" level="item"><did><unittitle>French Foreign Economic Policy under Mitterrand</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00012.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mosley, Mark</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a405cfac1ad36e3d48c794525e00efa0"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b1aed9b8001d8e6a7970ca09b909a710"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_f29b6b33953bc8a3871a8fe7e4c1e32e"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>6, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_2229e5c59b8ce5e5bd450c09750ad646" level="item"><did><unittitle>Book Review</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00012.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Pringle, Robert</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cohen, Benjamin J. </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1982/1982">1982</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d6f3503454997852986441a9875e495d">Book Review</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_38abe03bde4276d3ccc11a3bf4497a88"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b43b1d1af9e2e128283506acb217bb0d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer.

Inevitably, questions have resurfaced about the future viability of the Alliance. Dr. A. W. DePorte addresses these questions in a restatement of the case for the Atlantic Alliance, arguing that its primary goals are being met and that the Alliance need not be threatened by occasional (and inevitable) disputes over non-central issues. Following a discussion of the various perceptions of what the Alliance should accomplish and how it has in fact responded, the author suggests that the Alliance will continue to perform very well if it is released from the burden of unwarranted expectations.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e291d2dbb11206dfe76c634a481a055d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b7516d5d2c8c568eb7a985fc5234ab60"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_602fb1ec0b54c985137fbc060bb1e44b"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>7, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_6e792d0e716d65e3e6dcfe10231d4090" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Questionable Infatuation: Toward a Solution of the TNF Issue</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00013.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kessler, Glenn Andrew </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1983/1983">1983</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_79bcec39567850452472beb52cb7611d">The 1979 NATO decision to modernize its theater nuclear forces remains a divisive issue not only within European politics but between the United States and its NATO allies as well. In this article Glenn Kessler argues that while the original military rationale for the 1979 communique may be questionable, the political capital invested in the decision must not now be wasted. Accordingly, both the arms control and deployment components of the 1979 decision must be preserved in order to ensure the credibility of future NATO communiques. Kessler suggests a multiphase negotiation strategy to address these imperatives.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ccb3033bb0f2684942f3bce1a3945eed"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_de3ba7547c64bfda8a804d8531eecaf8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_deb609eec30b5758e4f11d5c2899ec48"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>7, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_8cc24165b25ac606af31d7b7f7802865" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Candid View of the Middle East: An Interview with Ambassador Hermann Frederick Eilts</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00013.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Eilts, Hermann Frederick</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1983/1983">1983</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e9497d0f0db3a7520a11096da0cf9a40">As a career foreign service officer, Hermann Eilts served in the Middle East for thirty-two years and was the U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1965 to 1970 and the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt from 1973 to 1979.

In this article, Scot Marciel describes the American use of arms for peace and assesses the value of arms in furthering the peace process. Critical of the vague analysis relied on by proponents of arms transfers, Marciel closely examines the particular kinds of goals American policymakers have hoped to achieve and the relationship between these goals and progress toward peace. After reviewing the history of American efforts to supply arms to support the peace process, Marciel concludes that, while well-defined and selective transfers of arms have assisted movements toward peace, the general utility of such transfers is questionable. Marciel urges that future arms transfers be considered more carefully to determine whether they actually fulfill a specific, concrete function in the peace process.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_12c3ace10aaebad7d0761b3f529853b4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_a75d3a0cd0e899e049d399d2ae36dbad"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_33d230b22df4b834799e578368262722"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>7, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_76a3a769ea14711afbe963cb44580df7" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Mass Migration of Refugees and International Law </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00013.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chamberlain, Margaret Dyer </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1983/1983">1983</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e10582384bb4f33059e7a1b9e3cd9e5b">Until the 1960s, international concern over "refugee" movements had essentially been restricted to conditions in Europe arising out of World War II.

In this article, Paul Sigur casts the main actors involved in international lending and borrowing, discusses the mechanism for debt rescheduling and analyzes three representative case studies of debt management. Sigur argues that the international financial system, though imperfect, has successfully dealt with debt crises and will continue to do so despite occasional fears of international financial collapse. The author concludes with some suggested reforms for the debt management process and a forecast of future developments.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ce290f4e20eb46e8ddeafd2af4d4e08d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6b37e3b88dd1e5881c8c4235e2249234"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_916afee5de396182ace9ee100baf2b50"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>7, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_a0ab927ab8bad13a9f05d54ea11ee824" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Puzzle Palace: A Report on America's Most Secret Agency</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00013.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bamford, James</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1983/1983">1983</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b376699d864097da1150126cd72c3ae3">Book Review</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d1077f15eb1218b6ca980b847c036b7c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_0dbc9f566566477c5473589a57a08f5c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_6550c08e865b6180458b1879d19b81aa"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>7, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_060273bc9bba941417e7c259d4674bed" level="item"><did><unittitle>Investigating the Puzzle Palace: An Interview with James Bamford</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00013.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brennan, Bonnie</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gilbert, Katherine </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1983/1983">1983</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_351093decf29991c3243d4d3a52e83e4">Interview</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_32e543c06418efcd85cd0eabae5b3a95"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_122d54c7db999d98ebc790c250bfe536"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_6f050d11bc8064746937491dac7cbd9d"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>7, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_2715591a28bb99f00b9a4945013a1612" level="item"><did><unittitle>Book Review</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00013.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gaddis, John Lewis</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Harris, Robert</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Paxman, Jeremy</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sauvant, Karl P.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1983/1983">1983</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_6f70d1f6aa6c382c8976ac458427abf5">Book Review</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6d8ab203133a99f5039ca3c32d341076"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e49cacc3254232ebecbeed8b5992a5ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter.

After first focusing on the agreement itself and Brazil's motivations for acquiring a nuclear reactor capable of producing weapons-grade material, Finkelstein argues that past American policies harmed both U.S. -Brazil relations and America's desire for nuclear nonproliferation.

Yet the international community has been selective in where it directs its attention, tending to emphasize the strategic importance of the region while neglecting the human aspects of Central America's turmoil. In the following article, Deirdre Kelly focuses on the human costs of Guatemala's ongoing civil strife. Kelly argues that the Guatemalan peasants who have sought refuge in neighboring Mexico have significantly affected both the domestic and foreign policies of Guatemala and Mexico.

The author first discusses the differences within the Church, concluding that the nuclear freeze represents the one point on the spectrum of options which can be supported by both conservative and liberal members of the Church. He then compares the religious freeze movement to its secular counterpart, arguing that the Church's accessibility and moral authority provide it with important advantages which the secular movement does not have. Newlin concludes by arguing that while disarmament advocates in the Church will not be able to convince middle America to support disarmament, they can serve an important educational role in the nuclear freeze debate.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_221afe305bb48384d5baca9644c87b82"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_138545e0d6e71fcadfb6b73c6a1f73fa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_43cf23772a7906a29e388c5d2075084a"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>7, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_26ac9ccfc3d619b2eef7ce0c292f7a87" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Policy Perspective on Dissent and Repression in the Soviet Union</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00014.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lynch, Allen</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1983/1983">1983</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_aa661505c91d10c2b6b86fe530ab09f9">In this commentary, Allen Lynch examines the process of dissent and repression in the Soviet Union from the point of view of American foreign policy.

In this article, Professor Alfred P. Rubin points out the similarities and the differences between concepts of morality, law and policy. He addresses the question of whether the mere possession of nuclear weapons is forbidden under existing law, and finds that it is not. Disagreeing with the U.S. government's official position that international law does not apply to the actual use of nuclear weapons, Rubin explains how policymakers should, and inevitably must, incorporate the rules of general international law into their decisions on the potential employment of nuclear weapons.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bdb2acbbecb699aaafc5117f34253c09"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_b7cf2a8b43a0167a11128f8edf9db495"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_c5c25479b75b13f0484a214d30a348b0"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_05bed177e89c0448821d83e53ecc2307" level="item"><did><unittitle>Japanese Offshore Banking: Toward a World Financial Center in Tokyo</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00015.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Robertson, Dario F.  </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_14da44acce91e14d0e6ed8f875e9339c">As part of a movement toward deregulation and internationalization of the Japanese financial system, policymakers in Japan are preparing to establish an offshore banking unit (OB U), similar to those already operating in New York, London, Singapore and Hong Kong. In this article, Dario F. Robertson examines (1) the probable institutional form of the Tokyo OBU; (2) its macroeconomic implications; and (3) suggestions for appropriate changes in Japanese policies to be pursued after the establishment of the OBU. He argues that the creation of an offshore banking facility in Tokyo is a feasible and desirable intermediate policy that will move the Japanese financial system significantly, if not inexorably, closer to complete deregulation. Robertson concludes that institution of an OBU in Tokyo will establish Japan in its rightful place as the predominant Asian financial center.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_6aadcd66512cf3a291d3ddf9bf3b0fbd"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e223e979fdcd4283bdcdc495a4258e46"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_5f84e5528bc579ed0c9053d53eb7d89c"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_09ea6f020ebf08908808887516a38091" level="item"><did><unittitle>Voice of America's Radio Station to Cuba</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00015.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Feltman, Jeffrey  </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_69a672a8363235d8f20174142d03dce1">In the fall of 1983, Congress passed legislation establishing a new U.S.-funded radio station aimed at broadcasting the �truth� about the Castro regime to the Cuban people. Feltman argues that Congress may have made a costly mistake. A Congressional compromise resulted in the creation of a specialized service aimed solely at Cuba, based on the examples of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Not only is this model inappropriate to the Cuban situation, Feltman asserts, but for the same broadcasting expense an expanded Voice of America could reach many more people, both in Cuba and in other Latin American nations far more likely to be influenced by the American viewpoint.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_46dca0d4e16ee09d0493de9b290ce25e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9996ffdf1d202ae035f2a8c83458033f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_5e1feb84c99eb868545d4b50789627d2"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_93c8cb7aecc03b903b4aa43497382709" level="item"><did><unittitle>Alliance Energy Security: 1945-1983</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00015.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kapstein, Ethan B.  </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_417231eda7609abf22cc0d15c09a11a4">In this article Ethan Kapstein traces the history of the Atlantic Alliance�s efforts to develop a collective, viable policy for energy security from 1945 to 1983. Although he generally believes that Alliance cohesiveness in this area appears to have suffered with the decline of U.S. hegemony and the oil shocks of the 1970s, there is still strong potential for maintenance of a coordinated policy. In his review of the postwar era Kapstein provides an interesting portrayal of the various methods by which the United States and Western Europe have cooperated to deal with the major supply crises of those years. He characterizes the present rules and norms governing alliance energy policy as an insurance regime, rather than a control regime, and concludes that the past achievements of alliance energy policy encourage hope for the future.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a807a20980a196e084360e267a40c4c8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_faf0def340a0219516014efb811fa507"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_737a3680170ebca195f57be6983bf0fd"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_112220a30bae362bf1ecf53040370580" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Prophet As Statesman: Kissinger, SALT and the Soviet Union</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00015.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hardt, D.

In this article, D. Brent Hardt explores the relationship between ideas and action in U.S. foreign policy in the Nixon White House. The author focuses on the areas of central concern both to Kissinger the academic and statesman _ negotiations, arms control and the Soviet threat. In evaluating Kissinger�s efforts in these areas, he concludes that theoretical approaches to foreign policy can be effective only if their limits are explicitly recognized.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8169ebda3cd9af8f2b4f849e1e856d8a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9051c27d7456f11de029b83c32a00bfb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_bc7af981b2ff48c55491154f44a038f6"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_4ef6853b370eba7119375d8d437b1420" level="item"><did><unittitle>Ballistic Missile Defense: Capabilities and Constraints</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00015.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Young, Alwyn</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9ae55e4287940a07d304c498b2434893">Numerous proposals for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) are receiving serious policy consideration, both in and out of government.

She argues that in Chile, despite the ascendancy of elected governments dedicated to land reform, legal institutions traditionally opposed to change _ such as the judiciary _ were able to thwart actual legislated reform. As a result, she asserts, the legal institutions themselves must undergo a transformation if popular demands for change are to be accommodated and stable development is to occur. Theorists of law and development must go beyond the instrumental and the culture-specific view of the role of law in change and recognize the need for fundamental changes in the legal thinking in contemporary Latin American society to better reflect the real customary law dictated by human needs and better facilitate the inevitable process of change.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_10e105b1e5461bc4016d94841d410e93"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_438ba6daf613134362899f43aeb7e542"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_ae1f93e2de07e84e16e17d3a5fefd4e7"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_a41f8c567ae022df553f4ba6c5e3c363" level="item"><did><unittitle>An Issue for the People: Civil Defense in the Nuclear Age</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00015.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mostow, Jonathan  </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_0e5588b5589023363eef9d7d3d8a1fee">Does the United States need a civil defense system? In the following article, Jonathan Mostow emphatically argues against the Reagan Administration's attempts to revive a national civil defense program and the false security which it engenders. The "city evacuation" concept is a mere update of the bomb shelter mentality of the 1950s, and no more effective now than it was then. Implementation of this policy would risk economic collapse, tempt the Soviets in the dangerous game of nuclear brinkmanship and undermine rather than contribute to national security. Speculating on potential scenarios and responses, Mostow unmasks the fatal logic of civil defense and reaffirms the validity of mutually assured destruction doctrine as a basis for preventing nuclear war.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8e3068ebe45ed871742db03faef184e5"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_f67073da24085c7010975cbaabf3ced9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_1a6f6cd2bb4053532388222203c09070"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_fdbb060805c55cefc15c6c46d03d1ec2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Book Review</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00015.00015</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Thompson, W.

In this article, Thomas Schwartz challenges this notion of early solidarity by revealing the divisions and delays that marked NATO's first security crisis - the 1950 decision to rearm Germany. Making use of recently released governmental sources, personal papers and memoirs, both European and American, the author provides a more complete and well-rounded picture of the crisis. In his account, Mr. Schwartz argues that particular solutions can best be understood by looking at the relative strength of the cross-national bureaucratic coalitions that form around them. Mr. Schwartz concludes that NATO's history reveals a recurrent pattern in the origin, development and resolution of security crises. This pattern of historical resiliency, he suggests, should caution against the tendency to view present discord as a threat to the future viability of the Alliance.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fadc40cd80f14594d42f2d956fa9092d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_374f06d1d8dc6333fada723c52a1418a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_6cd6d4b3d45db487cf2587d5818c34d7"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_2cf7a73f7ce39d11483c3a4c1a83d904" level="item"><did><unittitle>Compassion Versus Self-Interest: Who Shall Be Given Asylum in the United States? </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00016.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Burke, W.

For the United States the result has been unprecedented pressure on and questioning of its immigration policies generally, highlighted by thousands of evocative pleas for political asylum. Facing a dilemma of conscience and self-interest, United States officials have tried to fashion a policy that accommodates both concerns. W. Scott Burke, an official who has helped formulate such policies in the Reagan Administration, explains the difficulty of this problem and defends the government's solution in this thought-provoking article.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fc5a48ee140fa69381a55b4c0ef4f33a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_29a0d8bf50699613135988b1f04e9658"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_fca2ada4019b1fd01c93ab4f2298285b"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_c0abf27a7b90ec327f8186525fb21efc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Transborder Data Flow and the Protection of Privacy: The Harmonization of Data Protection Law</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00016.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cooepr, David M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b26b0b6ea6d3334e295e9264efcbda58">Recent developments in computer and communications technologies have facilitated the flow of information across national borders. The ease of gathering and transferring data has raised serious questions regarding the protection of the individual from the compilation and misuse of personal information. Governments have an interest in restricting some information flow, hut many businesses depend on the ability to send information freely across borders. In this article, David M. Cooper explores the complexity and variety of interests related to the problem of transborder data flow. He reveals how differing national interests in limiting the flow of data have led to the enactment of significantly different national data-protection and privacy laws in the United States and Europe. After surveying the developments in privacy legislation, Mr. Cooper reviews the recent attempts to harmonize these disparate national laws by implementing international guidelines and conventions. The author concludes by proposing several measures that can be taken by the United States to aid in efforts toward the harmonization of privacy law.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cf84b2a32a6a3674afb55f9359eb725c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_03dc2178f6ea18912d2fc2366113a84e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_63482ca7a92178feb6a5a94cd1991dbb"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_abf5604983c4811c75121621a2f10667" level="item"><did><unittitle>Public Diplomacy and the Past: The Search for an American Style of Propaganda (1952-1977)</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00016.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Roth, Lois W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_a361da34cc93c563c873488c957f7ed9">From the outset, the U.S. government's decision to practice the art of propaganda has been clouded by dissension over the scope and method of its mission. Definitions of propaganda, information and cultural affairs _ the fundamental elements of public diplomacy _ have consistently been obfuscated by canny bureaucrats and congressmen. Each administration has sought to devise formulae to create a program to best meet the perceived needs of the day. The present administration is no different from its predecessors in attempting to put its own imprimatur on its public diplomacy program. Under the direction of Charles Z. Wick, the United States Information Agency's visibility has heightened. Congress has rewarded the USIA's ambitious "offensive" programming plans with increased funding, especially those targeted at television, Voice of America and exchange programs. In this article, Ms. Roth emphasizes the 45-year debate concerning which elements should or should not be included in a public diplomacy program. Such an historical approach emphasizes the still-undefined character of USIA's role. It is of particular value in lending perspective and vision to those contemplating the future nature of public diplomacy programs in a representative democracy.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_95c325ed24a0f942d7d1859b5e438fef"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_2ac7d3297f19123f550ae21506340c7c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_a353d79865e5bebece8ad6f1c18fb2fb"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_b63032ba88ae37fd1d06d3cbf040eb77" level="item"><did><unittitle>Subsidies Law and Adjustment Policies: The 1982 EEC-US Steel Dispute Revisited</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00016.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Zimbler, Brian L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_637c26bc6611c8fd2c32f2da9464816a">In recent years most of the developed nations have shared problems of competitiveness and obsolescence in the manufacturing sectors of their economies, especially in the steel industries. Proposals for domestic adjustment policies, including government intervention to revitalize these industries, have prompted increased attention in some countries and implementation in others. Brian Zimbler explores the ramifications of such government intervention to support industrial competitiveness by examining the relationship between adjustment policies and the traditional agreements and rules which govern international trade. Finding that present rules are ill-suited for coping with widespread use of adjustment policies, Zimbler suggests - reasoning from the U.S. and international legal experience with the 1982 EEC-US steel dispute - that the developed countries should develop a cooperative and complementary set of adjustment policies through international negotiation in order to concentrate on sharing gains rather than apportioning losses.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5a87847271abbb7848e0aa42333bf119"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3b1e1dedd43b716854ec9e0b56c7f348"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_450915ddea0887ab4c133b7870a892d1"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>8, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_3508a6e9f73909be1ee147329f30d25c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Carter's Constitutional Conundrum: An Examination of the President's Unilateral Termination of a Treaty</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00016.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wachman, Alan W.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1984/1984">1984</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e9114d600edd54edd7996cc91a3b3d66">Although the U.S. Constitution defines the procedure for the Executive to enter into treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate, it says nothing about how such obligations may be terminated. This open constitutional question, a true conundrum, was directly raised by the Carter Administration's unilateral termination of the United States' Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan, upon normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China. Alan M.

In this interview, Ambassador Wisner outlines the major interests and policy objectives of the United States on the continent of Africa, focusing especially on the issues of southern Africa. He describes the U.S. policy of constructive engagement with respect to South Africa and its participation in negotiations aimed at reducing tensions in the region, expressing the view that only through such direct contacts can the U.S. hope to reduce the violence and oppression prevalent in the region and thereby create conditions which can expedite its social and economic development.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a3192b7ccb09924cbbd81ba105bb3441"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3ab51db36598756cc8dc601f6fa3b1e3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_b32ead77daf6e2901bdae756ac1b452f"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_a082edc650294bc76fc0a20e940c8f09" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Judiciary in Africa</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00017.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Aguda, Dr. T.

In his article, Dr. Aguda examines the potential power which members of the judiciary in Africa can derive through a constitutionally-based system of government for the administration of justice according to the rule of law. He analyzes the inherent and practical limitations upon this power which may be felt in cases of opposition by the executive branch, constitutional crisis, as in revolutionary states, and suppression of judicial autonomy, as may occur in one-party states. Having presented these theoretical points, Dr. Aguda cites numerous examples drawn from anglophone Africa to illustrate both the practical impact of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and the factors which mitigate against the judge's contribution to the building of social justice on that continent.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8dbe99a048727c20c969cbb6696a3330"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6562d7cad4048202c59338fdaaf5f7f2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_d33a381f881176d4e0fa60a26ce0affa"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_4decbd6833cbdd74cff67bf2b3bc4af3" level="item"><did><unittitle>United States Participation in the International Telecommunication Union: A Series of Interviews</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00017.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kinn, Robert A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_295ded3e54bac4e95525f1414a19abef">The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the oldest existing international organization. The increasing growth and application of telecommunications technology is fast creating global problems which the ITU is unaccustomed to handling. In this series of interviews Robert A. Kinn takes an in-depth look at recent U.S. involvement in the ITU and the direction future involvement will take. His questions address the perceived "politicization" of the ITU and U.S. strategies for dealing with the growing complexities involved in the international regulation of communications. The author sees the Office of Coordinator for International Communication and Information Policy as the first step towards the formation of a U.S. strategy for coping with growing international telecommunications needs. The growing importance of financial and technical assistance for telecommunications in developing countries is also addressed by Mr. Kinn. He concludes by looking at future ITU conferences, such as the "Space WARC" in August 1985, and U.S. policy-formation for that conference.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_39fd8928a3a163a3607bb4f718a1594e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6e858e853161a0cd7d80afe7cc5aab9f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_902c7bfb8f0c289b327419b1d4eb8549"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_760caa19771b3006727f29321953208d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Dissent and Decision-Making: A Study of George Ball's and John McNaughton's Opposition to the Vietnam War</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00017.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Kennedy, Ross A. </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_70fc1262cfdffa36321eea78bb266076">During the Vietnam War, public condemnation of continued U.S. involvement in Vietnam reached proportions unequaled during any previous war. Inside the government as well, there were voices which spoke, albeit carefully, against the continuing escalation of U.S. troops in Indochina. In this article, Ross A. Kennedy examines the processes of dissent and their influence on decision-making within the government. He discusses in detail the differing tactics of Under Secretary of State George Ball and Assistant Secretary of Defense John McNaughton in their attempts to alter governmental policy towards the war. After reviewing the efforts and tactics of these men with regard to their different positions within the government, Mr. Kennedy explores in detail their successes and failures.

The "Coordinating Committee on Export Controls" (CoCom), whose members include most of the NATO countries, has played an important role in controlling exports to communist countries. In this article, Timothy Aeppel argues that differences of perspective arising from the various "national styles" of CoCom member countries have reduced the effectiveness of CoCom. He then examines specific types of governmental disagreements about CoCom requirements, and discusses the ways in which those requirements have been circumvented. In conclusion, Mr. Aeppel asserts that for CoCom to overcome its internal disputes and remain an effective institution, concessions will have to be made on all sides.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_d7466574f68f0497a6da29e70284bf25"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_cba48a13df06cc3328b26c02d1008131"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_96b0bd256ff2e27ef7050f3044437aa2"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_1775c45d4c88b68e3febd55517115c9d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Portugal: From Empire to Nation-State</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00017.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Santos, Jos_ A.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b6a0628f93446072575aa566f4461a8a">In the mid-1970s, Portugal underwent a social revolution which caused the dismantling of its far-flung colonial empire. In this article, Jos_ Santos draws the important link between Portugal's domestic situation and its international position in the world, particularly in NATO, Europe, and Africa. He points out that the 1974 coup, which resulted in near chaos in Portugal, was to a large extent precipitated by the African policy of the Salazar-Caetano regime. He argues that although Portugal has ended its 600-year quest for a global empire, it is performing a new role in Africa, especially in its former colonies. Because Portugal's policies in those countries are aimed at benefitting the Alliance, the members of the Atlantic community have an interest in assisting Portugal in pursuing its objectives in Africa.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a2041167e97f4643e990c17a6adb945c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_4d3e0012b453a8e72a2ef3df5306a53c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_5df1667076c7d1b34d335f4434939dc0"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_9a1e31f8640a6d66a13d33486d5a5d37" level="item"><did><unittitle>Renaissance Through Technology: The European Community Decision on ESPRIT</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00017.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Laurent, Pierre-Henri</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f73c9dd627b88e731cfc55481cdbae50">The recent European Community (EC) decision to fund a new high- technology program known as ESPRIT (European Strategic Program for Research in Technology) is a major step towards EC unity in an area of growing importance. The development of information technology is a field in which Europe has been falling far behind the United States and Japan in recent years. In this article Pierre-Henri Laurent discusses the pressures behind the EC agreement to establish ESPRIT. He analyzes future European requirements in the information sector and the impact which ESPRIT could have on the European economy in general. ESPRIT marks a major new European initiative towards closing the gap between the levels of European and U.S. Japanese technological development, he argues. Mr. Laurent reviews the problems inherent in a program requiring long-term economic and political support from all EC members and suggests areas where short- term results could help promote the program.

His failures, though, stem not from a lack of concern towards Europe but more from a lack of understanding of how best to approach and secure NATO unity. In this article D. Brent Hardt explores Kissinger's views on alliance unity as exemplified in his Year of Europe with reference to his scholarly works. He reveals how Kissinger's work on nineteenth century European unity affected his views of twentieth-century Atlantic relations. Mr. Hardt discusses Kissinger's plan for unifying Europe and America as part of a deeply personal vision, one which ultimately failed because no other Western leader shared that vision. After examining Kissinger's grand design for alliance unity from both a European and an American perspective, Mr. Hardt points out the difficulty in translating a symbolic vision of unity into a substantive program for achieving that unity. The author concludes by assessing the prospects of a symbolic unity between the U.S. and Europe outlined by Kissinger both now and in the future.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2fe11fc17f5f3ff9d4608f7e18ffe201"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_66f9c60a5b6c98860ae8ee27e6457a13"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_a5e2b9042a4d61b5256ab87f744d7ee1"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_a778019a8fdfb0b9ee68c2c5e7da2c16" level="item"><did><unittitle>No-First-Use in U.S. Diplomacy, Deterrence Strategy, and Public Opinion</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00017.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nethercut, Richard D.  </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_907a4085ca988d2492af8cfa7967f8f7">When McGeorge Bundy, George Kennan, Robert McNamara, and Gerard Smith first proposed a no-first-use policy for the United States, they wrote that they aimed "to start a discussion, not to end it." In this article, Richard D. Nethercut offers his contribution to the ongoing debate over no-first-use. The author notes that unlike the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the United States does not have a clearly defined declaratory policy on the use of nuclear weapons. He reveals how this policy of ambiguity hinders the U.S. both abroad and at home. Nethercut provides a broad framework for U.S. nuclear policy and concludes that the U.S. should unilaterally endorse the concept of no-first-use with a multilateral NATO exception, as this would reduce tension, improve the prospects for arms control, make the American threat more credible, and present to the world a more responsible image of the U.S.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7b2dece554efb0565727756572dc8187"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_530824ec64f6282b9bf4434f03a4c173"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_339aea35a0569515c1663353f2c7a523"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_8ec14d90db3afdf58879f588b734fc10" level="item"><did><unittitle>Practice as a Guide to Treaty Interpretation</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00017.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">McGinley, Gerald P. </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_1a8ebd6b4e6afce2c6d680a51d7fdbb9">When interpreting international agreements, courts have often sought guidance in subsequent practice of the parties to the agreements.

Arthur Brown has been Associate Administrator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) since 1978, overseeing all operations of UNDP throughout the world. His vast experience in international development includes top-level positions in both the public and private sectors. From 1962 to 1977 he was responsible for all of Jamaica's negotiations with the IMF, the World Bank, multinational lenders, and foreign governments. Brown served as Alternate Governor of the World Bank, the IMF, and the Inter-American Development Bank. He also served as Alternate Governor of the Caribbean Development Bank, which he helped found. He was also a member of the Group of Twenty appointed by the IMF to reform the international monetary system. In this interview, Mr. Brown discusses the dilemmas of development confronting the island nations of the Caribbean. He evaluates the U.S. role in this region of growing unrest, focusing particularly on the impact and future prospects of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. In comparing the alternative strategies pursued by different countries, Mr. Brown concludes that more pragmatism combined with better management skills will be the keys to sustaining, and ultimately improving, the quality of life in the Caribbean.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2e7896ff787a45470013c78e54166d7c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3c8c8ef4b956a28d14521feea059ab0e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_9d723c5f1e8d6730c88b89de2e247258"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_99ee5f98d9fdc73ccdc192a2428f4025" level="item"><did><unittitle>Intertwined Futures: Puerto Rico and the U.S.</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00018.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Garc�a-Passalacqua, Juan M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_203a83d680c65c5eeb624bdc5ac8fb95">In this article, Mr. Garcia-Passalacqua emphasizes the historical and continuing significance of Puerto Rico to the stability of the Caribbean region and, by extension, to the security of the United States. After a brief overview of the island's colonial past, the author examines the forces operating across its current political spectrum and traces the interaction of these forces with the political and military presence of the United States. Mr. Garcia- Passalacqua finds that the political pressures building within Puerto Rico - as evidenced by shifting electoral alignments and by the actions of separatist terrorist groups - are being exacerbated by the apparent indifference of U.S. policymakers and the perception of increased U.S. militarization of the island. He concludes that the legitimacy of the island's political needs, the urgency with which those needs must be addressed, and the genuine strategic importance of Puerto Rico require that the U.S. act immediately to help define the island's future and end its current colonial status.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_414eace6d1d73fdef1ca37c45ec7eac2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_27cbfcccd25c7792a24263d716a82ad1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_cd68ede72e7b26e6b3b43078d213bf4c"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_82a76e00f9c97df1120f32aedde92973" level="item"><did><unittitle>Terrorist Warfare: Formidable Challenges </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00018.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Motley, James B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3854e3d77a0bb6cf23017fa5e959d962">In this article, Dr. Motley assesses terrorism as a form of warfare.

The author identifies the Soviet Union's strategy of promoting subversion abroad and its practice of financing and supplying subversive groups both directly and through surrogates as the key threat which terrorism poses to Western interests. He traces some of the ties through which Soviet direction and support are transmitted to those engaged in subversive activities and uses the example of Armenian terrorism to demonstrate the connection between terrorist objectives and Soviet interests. In conclusion, Mr. Henze emphasizes the need for Western and non-aligned nations to understand and expose the extent of Eastern-bloc support of terrorism and to improve further their channels of communication as means of reducing its occurrence.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_28d0dab9b4099811d0fd20450152f36f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6fa77cdb9fea34b4d13df03cdbb291b4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_2ec3cfb7bc3897bc344d41665ca7eb47"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_82514b95fb03a0a6f68a3fb98108946a" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Nexus of Culture and Politics: A Study of Film in U.S.-China Relations </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00018.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Gong Hancock, Marguerite</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f5f769b962da1a102a5a40ed35234882">Throughout Chinese history the interaction of politics and culture has been paramount in defining China's identity as a state and as a civilization. In this article, Marguerite Gong Hancock analyses this historical interplay from the arrival of Western traders in the mid-nineteenth century to the nationalism ultimately embodied in the People's Republic of China (PRC). She argues that despite changing regimes and ideologies, the Chinese leaders of the twentieth-century have continually manipulated specific cultural forms, such as film, to accomplish political aims. Examining U.S. policies designed to improve relations with the PRC, Mrs. Gong Hancock proposes that because of this Chinese fusion of culture and politics, the export and exchange of American films has accurately reflected the evolving state of U.S.-China relations, as well as served as a tool for building bilateral relations with the PRC.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a3fc813d3b6cc42e2710e59ece9e1e2a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3abae765f1ad2fa82222a6517fad13cc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_bba0411aec7ba4874cb2a9cdaca91e26"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_04b35a58a34aa04f43c11659a034f8d4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Hong Kong and Singapore: The Future of Asian Financial Centers </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00018.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Johnson, Edith E.M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5b2f0e8b1c41e0b4e3bf2c79a6207604">Hong Kong and Singapore currently serve as Asia's two main financial centers.

In this article, Augusta Pipkin reviews the work of the major foundations in the field of international affairs, and finds that their influence and importance are now diminishing because of increased government involvement in international aid programs. Ms. Pipkin argues that large foundations such as Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller have been affected more seriously than have the newer, smaller foundations.

In this article Frank C. Pandolfe traces U.S. activities in Nicaragua from 1912-1933. He argues that it is only through an analysis of past United States relations with Nicaragua that we can fully understand present problems between the two countries. Examining both the type and extent of U.S. involvement in Nicaragua in the years between 1912 and 1933, he points out that the internal political situation of both countries affected the U.S. decision to intervene with economic and military aid. Mr. Pandolfe then discusses the impact of United States troops and funds on Nicaraguan political and economic stability, asserting that many of the problems associated with the U.S. presence were the results of conflicting expectations within the United States and Nicaragua. Ultimately, U.S. intentions in Nicaragua were good, the author concludes, but political stability must be the product of Nicaragua, not of foreign intervention.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_417f919e6f12791274f80aef08554406"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_62ae2eb35729a0253add9871ed1af45a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_bfdcd109018b55c882649503b4f11327"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_203d2df416aac4c6ddd28f6824b405bd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Brazilian Informatics Policy: What Price Sovereignty? </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00018.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Johnson, Jean</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2a6e617fd5f8f1d580a1491d0177f399">In recent years, Brazil has developed an advanced technological base and a strong computer and data services sector. Recent policies aimed at protecting its domestic market put it in direct conflict with U.S. policies which seek to open foreign markets to U.S. exports and investment opportunities. In this article, Jean Johnson examines how Brazil's concern for its national security, technological independence, and development into an "information society" has led to the imposition of a policy of strict protection for Brazil's computer, or informatics, industry for at least the next eight years. Although the policy stems from legitimate concerns about the need to preserve Brazil's sovereignty, and to further its economic development, there are considerable obstacles in the way of its success. Nevertheless, Brazil does have a strong political commitment to see it succeed, and as Ms. Johnson advises that strident opposition from the U.S. may only exacerbate the already strained diplomatic relations between the two countries. A successful Brazilian effort to promote its technological and economic development will benefit U.S. interest in the long run, she concludes.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e27044551c8e70673a9fda3fb57f51c8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_f3306d38e56781bd66a47645f513b861"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_fb99d8a10f2e29fa6f48e9a9d20bf2a3"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>9, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_011007c39b5d7e9cb5a5226d792ce01c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Remote Sensing: American Law and Sensed States' Demands </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00018.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Biondo, Jeannette</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1985/1985">1985</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ddb126fc75b72885bebc75301d2e5bc4">With the impending potential privatization of the United States' successful Landsat remote sensing system, attention is being focused on the legal issues surrounding the operation of these "eyes in the sky."

announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative. In this article, Timothy H. Hiebert argues that their response sprang not only from such traditional fears as that of a decoupling of Europe from American military protection, but also from the manner in which the United States presented SDI. Had President Reagan introduced SDI as a modification of NATO's current strategy of deterrence rather than as a radical departure from it, the author asserts, he might have secured broader European support. Mr. Hiebert concludes that as a result of the intra-alliance controversy over SDI, American officials have begun to adjust their public position on SDI to accommodate European concerns.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_885ebacd5e144f094a110fe37d1282fc"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_072de53ad3e6e5969d9bacb82b6a240a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_2e8fb29ac4aca493824140cc8044ddbc"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_07134d25e2e14a52256fe8f0c5dda252" level="item"><did><unittitle>Strategic Defense in Perspective: Nuclear Weapons and American Globalism</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00019.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Springer, John C.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1986/1986">1986</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_66d57f735620c9d71e3367b616597778">President Reagan's announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in March 1983 took everyone but his closest advisors by surprise. In response, critics have declared the program to be a radical break from American attitudes toward nuclear weapons _ partly because of the suddenness of the President's announcement, and partly because it appears very different from the more traditional U.S. strategy based upon retaliatory deterrence. In this article John C. Springer argues that SDI is in fact part of a logical progression in American strategic thinking. After a short history of American attitudes toward war and the role of force in international relations, Mr. Springer takes a closer look at the evolution of nuclear strategy from this historical perspective. He concludes that no matter how much SDI may deviate from the strategy of deterrence, the idea of creating a defense against nuclear weapons is deeply rooted in American culture and history.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f67d5e42fe81ea5f9eb8d398f809f9e1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6571f94ca3c90885a1623cb686632d09"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_92ee507a8c201f13d9c5ea7dc54b9eed"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_733dc5c6c5ea7e3944975547b877aac4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Thinking Twice: The Weinberger Doctrine and the Lessons of Vietnam</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00019.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Alterman, Eric R.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1986/1986">1986</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_80fb1b55224eb1188489ac96e4b1afa2">Debate is still raging over the Vietnam experience: why did we get involved, why did we lose, and what does our military failure mean for the future of U.S. foreign policy? In this article, Eric R. Alterman argues that, though consensus on these questions remains elusive within the U.S. civilian community, the outlines of an emerging consensus are evident within the U.S. armed forces. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger's now- famous speech on the six essential conditions necessary before war should be fought reflects this military consensus. Mr. Alterman analyzes each of Weinberger's points in the context of military conclusions from the Vietnam era. He concludes that the lessons from Vietnam drawn by the armed forces can be seen clearly in the military's restraining role in recent U.S. policy toward Central America and Lebanon.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e36fbd2a5335074801d1e9b5d32ad433"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_2243eab232f039f2daf6aadcaabbb246"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_e302bed3eaa551522b337c9d6f6a8da2"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_d1e0ef90f115ff179c87cb63ec944662" level="item"><did><unittitle>Confidence-Building Measures: Rescuing Arms Control </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00019.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Borawski, John</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1986/1986">1986</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_82a5983e3907c517835208803e581a58">The historically discouraging experience of arms control talks, combined with new threats to peace, has recently focused attention on peripheral yet equally important measures of maintaining the stability of the world military balance. John Borawski views these alternative tactics, known as "confidence-building measures" or CBMs, as useful in a multitude of situations. By institutionalizing increased communication and information exchange, the observation and inspection of opposing forces, and the limitation of potentially threatening activities, CBA is actually complement arms control agreements. In addition, he asserts, unintended crises may be avoided through the use of the greater communication provided by CBMs. Mr. Borawski concludes that whatever their utility outside of arms control, arms limitation agreements themselves will be only as effective as the confidence inspired by CBM agreements.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0d8a3dfee6296867e862600fd0080a75"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6c6bc968c9974cb00836bfc0b5ccbfa9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_1a448a035939b68fb7b85f7125de7e0c"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_d434523bc7a0ed5bb4ec06ab896215c5" level="item"><did><unittitle>Fundamentalism or Realism: The Future of the Greens in West German Politics</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00019.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sevcenko, Catherine B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1986/1986">1986</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ff3fb760cc7e1457d8916058c2c0c813">The German Green Party is at a critical juncture in its political development. With enough political weight to influence elections, it faces a choice between its practice of total opposition to the established system or collaboration with that system to bring about change. In her article, Catherine B. Sevcenko compares the present dilemma of the Greens to that of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) at the turn of the century. Arguing that both parties have represented anti-establishment movements searching for a utopian ideal, she states that the path chosen by the SPD offers the Greens a model for political survival. In the end the SPD compromised its ideals and recognized political reality, and Ms. Sevcenko concludes that the Greens must also balance principle and pragmatism if they are to survive as a political party.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5d8d2a85bb9e0324d4b1eae58e6edea7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_e2a6be4fcdd9ea0f32a251caf0f90dff"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_af2713aaec4cbe8ae0f4530c461643ce"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_0ddcd0fc7b93503cd16378c62e2d984c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Book Review</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00019.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Herczegh, Geza</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Coil, Alberto R.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Arend, Anthony C.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Arkin, William</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fieldhouse, Richard W.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Speiser, Stuart</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1986/1986">1986</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_2caf0aa94d6f4f0b0892b22a9735f159">Book Review</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_310a89236a875a0c5df98207230319c7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_8fc4eee58e8d700a35aca7a2ab80c587"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter.

In recognition of Pakistan's important geostrategic position, the United States concluded a $3.2 billion economic and security agreement with the country in 1981, and concluded a follow-up agreement for over $4billioninMarch1986. In this article, Devin T. Hagerty argues that contrary to popular belief, Pakistan's current role is not a new one in American strategic planning. He analyzes the initial era of security relations between the U.S. and Pakistan from 1947 to 1954, and discusses the parallels between the 1981 agreement and the considerations leading to the famed "northern tier" concept of John Foster Dulles. Mr. Hagerty concludes that the strategic thinking which evolved in that crucial period, resulting in the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement of 1954, forms the basis for the present-day relationship.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7f733bbafb6969100ae0f492c66d1615"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9774c5fc2b202c3392d81fbff0232118"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_f3dff8e40ffca91696baac01fafa072a"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_0ccabce8c2d452b2475b075d935a01b8" level="item"><did><unittitle>Foreign Banks in China: Current Prospects Under a Changing Financial System </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00020.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shapiro, Lawrence Paul  </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1986/1986">1986</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_61b2ceedf9b97657eff76b4e6efe405f">In response to policy changes by the Chinese government, since 1979 over five dozen foreign banks have set up representative offices in Beijing alone. Since the declaration of four Special Economic Zones in 1985, foreign banks  have also opened branches in China. In this article, Lawrence Paul Shapiro analyzes these recent reforms of the Chinese banking system and argues that, despite what appears to be official Chinese encouragement of foreign banks, it is unlikely that large numbers of foreign banks will be able to participate profitably in the Chinese domestic market. Current reforms, according to Mr. Shapiro, have left unaffected the system of state controls on business and banking which both makes credit analysis for foreign banks difficult and makes competition with Chinese banks, with their controlled source of deposits and allocations, virtually impossible. Further and more significant reforms, such as allowing foreign banks to deal in local currency, are necessary before foreign banks will be fully incorporated into the Chinese system. The author concludes that though current prospects for foreign banks in China may appear bleak, there is hope that such reforms will be passed, and that those banks which choose to remain now may eventually profit in the future.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_95e25cc83287ca5b77b80de64cf3e364"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_7971011d8174667bfa7530a777e3c5e9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_1db21a8630062e533f3b33c31bf1de85"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_9a4bff9cc8b4835eb39eafd66c51bb4b" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Reagan Administration's Battle for Foreign Aid </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00020.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hardt, D.

Perhaps more interesting than the sheer doggedness of the administration has been its willingness to modify its purported objectives in order to secure support for the aid requests. D. Brent Hardt, in a revealing anatomy of the battle for contra aid, details how the administration's position evolved from competing views within the White House to focus on the interdiction of supplies to El Salvadoran rebels, then on internal Nicaraguan reforms, and finally on the all but stated desire to overthrow the Sandinista government. The changes in the administration's stance, according to Mr. Hardt, were largely induced by Congressional pressures. With survival of the contras as a political force at stake, the Reagan administration will pull out all the stops in an ongoing effort to secure financial assistance for the rebels. The author concludes that the contras will remain the cornerstone of an inconclusive and ambiguous U.S. policy toward Nicaragua.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bab09ea85f783fa6813e2e18ef7e0994"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_8ed9fbf9a29fa8fdf44ebae73674f611"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_1f34c6f5399a1d2b9b00c72f6d593d2a"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_d97a9d82ed4d6ea9c38c7a84b6a02d36" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Central American Dilemma: West German Perceptions and Options</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00020.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hess, H.

As H. Jiirgen Hess outlines in this article, the European Economic Community is the second largest trade partner for many of the Central American countries. In the case of West Germany these historically strong economic ties, often in opposition to United States policy, are complicated by equally strong present _ day security ties with the United States. The West German government must strengthen NATO and at the same time respond effectively to strong domestic opposition to United States policy in Central America. Mr. Hess surveys the historical relationship between West Germany and Central America and the current policies of the four West German political parties represented in Parliament toward the region. He argues that policy options are limited, given overwhelming U.S. influence in the region. But though West German attitudes toward NATO and Central America seem to conflict, the author concludes that opposition to United States military involvement in Central America springs from a conviction that the deployment of United States forces in the region would only weaken NATO and increase German domestic opposition to West German ties with the United States.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ac9292fc1ca504d5192956ed6868c2a8"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_6edce4ca9c18897aa5eaf42e5c6d0301"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_a6375084489d47a02809a97150f76e9d"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_7faa3e5a8828860a7159e327a340b234" level="item"><did><unittitle>Liberation Theology as a Revolutionary Ideology in Latin America </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00020.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jacobson, Roberta Steinfeld  </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1986/1986">1986</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_29afa933e0dbedc5636c78ca77cd5533">The doctrine of liberation theology in Latin American revolutionary movements has sought to bridge the gap between Marxism and Catholicism, by blending religious dogma and Marxist theory into a plan of action for improving social conditions. Roberta Steinfeld Jacobson outlines the attitudes both of the Catholic Church and the Soviet Union toward this hybrid doctrine. She then shows that liberation theology effectively promotes revolution but so far has been unable to survive as an alternative to traditional Catholic doctrine after the first phase of a revolutionary struggle is over. She concludes with a discussion of policy recommendations for the American government in coping with the influence of liberation theology on revolutionary movements.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f0b459995311329c1f02099625ee265d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_df136cf247368f3a3a310c88a5dd37c9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_d7b088a05efa125f25257eef3e932fd8"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>10, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_da2156b539cd0602610f5ff4b12aae9a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Book Review</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00020.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jervis, Robert</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lebow, Richard Ned</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stein, Janice Gross</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Zoller, Elisabeth</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Burenstam Linder, Staffan</corpname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Aluko, Olajide</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shaw, Timothy M.  </persname></origination><unitdate normal="1986/1986">1986</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_c1dcd591dc00ad8c6bc280032f5bc924">Book Review</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_49d9906584ce2508d34abcb54a7bd51c"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_2e442007169d4b4997a69b387b70f004"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer.

Falling oil prices have further exacerbated the war-related hardships. In this wide-ranging essay, Anne-Marie Johnson examines the measures Iraq has taken to meet the economic demands of this war. Iraq has developed export outlets, rescheduled its debt, built new transport facilities, and partially liberalized its private sector. Ms. Johnson concludes that Iraq has positioned itself favorably to deal with current and future challenges posed by the international economic environment.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_8bb8bddbe406d4af2378ad2fb0c493b7"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_532838657100d4e698f7e6e799a24295"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_339baf84aace01a01332b9a9200ba81a"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>11, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_24bcc494039af2461cb417e35ce12f8b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Political Legitimacy and National Identity in Saudi Arabia: Competing Allegiances</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00021.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="local">Weston III, Frederick W.</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="1987/1987">1987</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_b35a7b31960a0b1ab06a6da59dc378a5">National identity in the Arab world is a tenuous concept, often intertwined with and overshadowed by social and cultural allegiances. The Al-Saud family, rulers of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, have managed to unite the disparate religious and ethnic elements of their society - at least they have united them enough to forge a functioning nation-state. But not all Saudi subjects accept the Al-Saud's kingdom as synonymous with their own concept of a true national identity. Frederick W. Weston, III traces the history of the Al-Saud's efforts at state-building and concludes that national identity is still an unresolved question for the kingdom. Modernization has strengthened allegiance to the nation but weakened allegiance to the state (the Al-Saud) among the emerging middle class; this has potentially serious implications for the ruling family's political legitimacy.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0ed09b73798aa5bcd536a7f3f1efdee3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_84c0a5ab0eb875a86eeec70507b50704"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_ac14d49d1502cc27d2f533711b9cdd98"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>11, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_eb29f298e91054d746df1296728bf3c0" level="item"><did><unittitle>The U.S.-China Nuclear Agreement: A Failure of Executive Policymaking and Congressional Oversight </unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00021.00010</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Homer, Daniel</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Leventhal, Paul</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1987/1987">1987</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e21f3a5ebe4a5374be3b7cc5ae63c04d">The agreement for nuclear cooperation signed by the United States and China in July 1985 is a watershed for U.S. policy on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. It provides an important barometer of the current commitment in Washington to the requirements of U.S. nonproliferation law and sets a precedent for future U.S. nuclear agreements. The results, conclude Daniel Homer and Paul Leventhal, are not encouraging. In negotiating the agreement, the Executive Branch allowed China to avoid key requirements of U.S. law. Congress had ample opportunity to remedy these defects but chose simply to paper them over. Mr. Homer and Mr. Leventhal describe and comment upon the process by which the U.S.-China agreement was negotiated and reviewed and consider the implications of this flawed agreement.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c49d4a00ab6d7dd98f1e99cdb8cdcefa"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_37e7c16f06c233353c12b3f49c21f36a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_b3e3689c303c2fe88230d8973ba405b6"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>11, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_e6984e8c4a3c5bde6bfd1487488bdafc" level="item"><did><unittitle>Arms Control Objectives of the Reagan Administration</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00021.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rovit, Sam B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1987/1987">1987</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_e0aaa4545fb2eabef5863569db5b1973">Arms control proposals crafted by the Reagan administration have been more ambitious in their scope than all that preceded them. Curiously, these proposals were developed by men who, prior to their appointment to the administration in 1980, were sharply critical of past American arms control efforts. A common refrain among them was that arms control should do less, rather than more. Sam Rovit explores this contradiction by analyzing the striking contrast in the positions of arms control architects Richard Perle and Richard Burt prior to and since joining the Reagan White House. Mr. Rovit concludes that this dichotomy represents the key to understanding the true objectives of arms control in the Reagan administration- objectives distinct from those publicly proclaimed-</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_397a4386a9da10c612bb9b7d1f508ca3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_db3c08904fdcd896d7b590d894c7885f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_3751c44595b88787f0689cc703a5b54a"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>11, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_34403aa2813279dcdb838b29b44f0a1a" level="item"><did><unittitle>Book Review</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00021.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cohen, Benjamin J. </persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gwyn, Richard</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Johnson, R.W.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hersh, Seymour</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1987/1987">1987</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7e9c9a39701e8601a39e05e31e7cd0bb">Book Review</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e7eb16dfbfbdb5fe81cc701319f07a89"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_5a6d3a60c275b4fd62c28753a61964c4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter.

The invasion provoked considerable controversy in the United States, but often forgotten or overlooked by both supporters and opponents of the action was that the decision to invade was not made unilaterally. Rather, as D. Brent Hardt argues, Grenada's neighbors in the eastern Caribbean played a major role in initiating the intervention. According to Mr. Hardt, the Reagan administration probably would not have intervened in the absence of Caribbean support. This multilateral character of the intervention, he concludes, made it a political success in Grenada, the Caribbean, and the United States.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bfec68c485ce7bd9b8c8fd58353e7676"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_665ce16a5aa0f37ac7033ebc306198a9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_bca6a217cdf7cf2e2b8eac3121eedeac"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>11, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_be8a11c7cb523b509fa95d2a75e06a75" level="item"><did><unittitle>Project Food Aid: Tool for Rural Development?</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00022.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ice, Mark E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1987/1987">1987</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_312ed8a52ea48bfbc19144ab2840a169">Properly utilized, project food aid has a legitimate role to play in development programming. Yet, because its budgetary costs are largely hidden and its rhetoric is so overtly humanitarian, it has been embraced uncritically and used indiscriminately. Evaluation has concentrated on the achievement of immediate, specific goals, such as the construction of a school or an irrigation canal. The author draws upon extensive field experience as a relief program administrator and a review of recent writings to assess the broader impacts of project food aid upon the complex socioeconomic environment of entire communities. In contrast to normal expectations, a feeding program can lead to a degraded nutritional status within the target group; an irrigation canal built by Food for Work can leave its rural laborers relatively worse off. These and other paradoxes are explored. In concluding, the author identifies some key considerations for improving the effectiveness and curbing the dangers of project food aid.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_66572d9706c35bcb340b70b5e1577509"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_3e05d33650fadd1b2bbc170c7a51c758"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_9415a6f9dd44c37a5185c101cb885500"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>11, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_dbe4a4084f8825c3bdf3b851c6d88e6b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Dangling Carrots Before Marxists: U.S.-Mozambican Relations Since 1981</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00022.00015</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nash, Philip</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1987/1987">1987</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ad15ad1bc04334e2ecd3726edb7e7b97">One of the more controversial developments in recent U.S. foreign policy is the adoption of the "Reagan Doctrine," a policy that includes support for guerrilla movements opposed to Soviet-backed states in Central America, Asia, and Africa. Yet in an apparent reversal of its own doctrine, the Reagan administration has sought closer relations with the avowedly Marxist-Leninist government of Mozambique. Philip Nash examines the origins and development of this relationship from both the American and Mozambican viewpoints, and introduces a more general question: how can a government, while seeking to enlist support for the broad themes of its foreign policy, retain the flexibility to deal with local issues in a way that, on the surface, runs counter to those themes?</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_9175c5332874f80a1193dcdfb52d3914"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_9ec3cb9083d1f926325de8226e55ff67"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_978c0aadeba7e7a80d5ac3931ca1bb0f"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>11, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_01943f276b541966d6ee1314dbef22af" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Internationalization of the Korea Stock Exchange</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00022.00016</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Thompson, Steven F.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1987/1987">1987</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_47811e604a77b0c95b85e06e8895c8f5">In recent years, the South Korean government has given the Korea Stock Exchange (KSE) a key role to play in its drive to internationalize the economy and diversify its financial base. Such was not always the case, argues Steven Thompson in this survey of the history of the stock exchange and of Korean equity funds currently operating abroad. For years, the availability of government-subsidized loan capital allowed Korea's largest corporations to avoid listing themselves on the exchange, leaving the KSE weak and prone to manipulation by a few powerful speculators. Current government policy to stimulate the exchange involves a tradeoff: heavy regulations help stabilize the KSE, yet they also tend to inhibit its growth. Based on interviews with officials of the KSE and the Ministry of Finance and with Korean academics, Mr. Thompson proposes specific steps the Korean government should take to solve this dilemma.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_3c94edca5e88bb963e9af2f5208af450"><head>Conditions Governing

Michael A. Hammer, in a series of interviews with key American and Salvadoran officials, details how circumstances forced the Reagan administration's policies to change, and even to resemble those of his predecessor. In protracted warfare, Hammer argues, executive policy must reflect congressional consensus or lose funding. In El Salvador the result has been an American foreign policy that seeks to promote progressive change rather than reinforce the reactionary status quo.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2e980bae04bc776386f157eddb8c4bae"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_089e2d934104a673a181d9a95edc480d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_1d3c00828903e63196379e02e2ba85d3"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>12, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_adac80524f81e71cc60bda6274067fb1" level="item"><did><unittitle>Chinese Military Modernization and the Open Door Policy</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00023.00012</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rovit, Sam B.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1988/1988">1988</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_303b80cf13a33d749ec0eba3088526b5">When China began to open its doors to the West, party leaders gave top priority to economic development, deemphasizing the role of the military. Deng Xiaoping himself stated that the international situation made it possible for China to spend less on defense and more on economic construction. But the military has not been entirely neglected in the pursuit of these new policies.

The membership proposal was defeated by a margin of three to one. In this paper, C. L. Robertson examines the reasons for the outcome of the referendum. He argues that the decision was a product of the electorate's poor opinion of the UN as well as its perception that membership would deprive Switzerland of its neutral status.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7d3e48edff7f56347bf24af6f3ae51b1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c43525f2edcac52fbcb8aadfb4a666ba"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_958e0698eb2099ab535568c0489aa286"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>12, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_dfadd46a598b0b26c1a7893aa2a4304f" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Spain-NATO-United States Triangle: Who Controls the Negotiations?</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00024.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ford, Robert E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1988/1988">1988</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_3fc16c04004bc47616f758baaa0ab21b">Spain's role in NATO historically has been both ambiguous and heavily influenced by Spain's relations with the United States.

We asked: what strategic concepts should the United States espouse when conducting foreign relations with other nations? Our roundtable featured Walter Manger, currently the State Department's desk officer for the Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Tanzania, whose most recent tour was at the United Nations Political Office. Captain William Spencer Johnson, the Pentagon's deputy chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy, and Operations; Alexis Rieffel, an assistant to the US executive director of the International Monetary Fund; and Peter Galbraith, staff member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As moderator, Fletcher's Alan K. Henrikson lent his exhaustive knowledge of American foreign policy. Representing themselves rather than their institutions, the panelists unanimously rejected the idea of "going it alone." But a belief in American leadership suffused their remarks.

It has never had an army. While it supported, in principle, a defense of Europe, historically, it has avoided alliances.

Egypt initially justified its military intervention on the basis of bilateral defense agreements. Mark Robertson explains, however, how the Egyptians quickly abandoned this rationale in favor of inchoate principles of Arab unity, carefully legitimizing its "ethnic intervention" with explicit references to primary international legal norms.

Shipment of hazardous waste between OECD countries is extensive and has been going on for years. Until recently, however, little has been known about hazardous waste shipments from the industrialized North to the less developed South. Some Third World leaders point to the lack of binding international law, calling the issue "toxic terrorism" and "garbage imperialism." In this article Ms. Susanne Rublack summarizes international regulatory efforts to control such movements and traces the evolution of an upcoming UN-sponsored international convention on trans-frontier shipment of hazardous waste.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_47eebf660b116c7911f57842dd42ba20"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_567c045fbf303a27d09e395cdad873e2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_ac14aebd7033a8a6caf86cbe59126f06"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>13, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_22ef7c171e853b35aa42ddf27a27ca57" level="item"><did><unittitle>Software Production and Development Policy Alternatives: Brazil and Singapore</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00025.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rauenhorst, Amy M.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_444b73aa640a9153ac8d2226e48db776">Accelerated growth in technology, particularly computer technology, has come to play a significant role in shaping national economic policy planning and development. As a part of this growth, the development of an indigenous software industry can provide a critical link between a country's production needs and available computer hardware. Ms. Rauenhorst presents case studies of software development policy in Brazil and Singapore- two regional technology leaders- including the influences of government ideology and foreign investment and the problems of piracy and copyright infringement. She concludes that the divergent paths followed by Brazil and Singapore vividly illustrate options available to developing countries intending to nurture such indigenous industry.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_7b94ea256563e8871c8f472151e30938"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_645ce560c9c57e0b77776ffb68e22b1e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Winter</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_59450ff557ec95e6855df90087b5bd7f"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>13, 1</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_ee5457203a8c3f331639ff498ed32e7d" level="item"><did><unittitle>Book Review</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00025.00014</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shawcross, William</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lang, James</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Brown, J.F.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Elagab, Omer Yousif</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bill, James</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stevenson, Robert L.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wu, Yuan-li</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Michael, Franz</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cooper, John F.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lee, Ta-ling</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chang, Maris Hsia</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Gregor, A.

remaining political strongman in South America. Even in Chile today, political forces are negotiating a transition to a more pluralist society. Perhaps the event most responsible for this movement is the Chilean plebiscite of October 1988. Peter Quilter takes us back to the month preceding the vote, and focuses on the role of television in a curiously restrained political environment. The story of those twenty- eight days gives us much insight into the nature of Chilean society under military rule, and importantly, what awaits it in the future. This is the story of the brief appearance of opposition advertisements on television, and the impact it had on the Chilean plebiscite.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a3499a5a05c5c99cbc9e842f696c433d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_05d00c798121ead96c70f5a07fd716b8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_a6768abbae3a1e8160e14fb4d625b1d9"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>13, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_b9200a49a052cec6e1ce69a0778262ff" level="item"><did><unittitle>Gray Market Controversies: The 1980s and Beyond</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00026.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lipner, Seth E.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f611c2721a04227ca7bb2e69c5ae5b59">Gray market goods are genuine trademarked goods, imported without the permission of the local trademark owner.

Olguin examines how the Mexican government is dealing with its Guatemalan refugees with respect to basic customary law and international legal standards. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the recognized authority in refugee law and plays a major role in providing the day-to-day assistance in refugee camps, which Mr. Olguin describes in detail. The doctrines of asylum, non-refoulement, and temporary refuge are also discussed, and the article concludes by considering voluntary repatriation as a viable option.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_009877c8b1130ef4695f7def89d12833"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><scopecontent id="aspace_c0a61efb6c7da63de82da86186d9bbc7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Summer</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_7ee477f53c665e51a00549870a739e01"><head>Volume, issue</head><p>13, 2</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_040130dc0996065dd9a2c9300e01ff1c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Korean Reunification</unittitle><unitid>UP149.001.00026.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lee, Charles F.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_d82c37d3f5e8d211c8e5a8ca0cd98463">Conventional wisdom, both Korean and non-Korean, assumes the division of this strategic peninsula to be temporary.

He argues that these distinctions are significant, often in ways that may seem opaque to outsiders.
