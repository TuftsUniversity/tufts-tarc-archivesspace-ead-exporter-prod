    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Delta chapter of Alpha Omicron Pi was established at Tufts University in 1908. The Delta chapter grew out of Alpha Delta Sigma, a local Greek letter society organized by six women (including founder Mary Grace Fickett, 1896) at Tufts in 1895. After association with other local societies in the New England area, Alpha Delta Sigma was formally initiated as the Delta chapter of Alpha Omicron Pi-- a national sorority founded in 1897—in the "wee small hours" of the morning of April 14, 1908. In the 1960s, members of the Delta chapter refused to participate in recruitment activities to protest the discriminatory recruitment rules of the Tufts Panhellenic Council; as a result, the chapter's charter was held in trust from 1969 until 1987, when the chapter was reestablished. </p><p>From 1987 through 2017, the Delta chapter held regular programs including recruitment and bid parties, philanthropy events, new member retreats, formal dances, and Big Sister Hunts. The chapter also participated in wider events and programming for Greek organizations at Tufts. The Delta chapter received the Tufts Mount Olympus Award—the award for Greek Chapter of the Year—numerous times between 1990 and 2017, and also received awards from Alpha Omicron Pi including the Academic Development Cup, the McCausland Cup, the Sheaf Performance Award, and awards for outstanding public relations and outstanding reporting. The motto of the Delta chapter was "strength through fellowship."</p><p>In September of 2016, a transgender student rushed the Delta chapter. After a delay in affirming the bid from Alpha Omicron Pi International, which oversees recruitment activities of all chapters, more than half of Delta's members left the sorority in October of 2016. The remaining members discussed leaving the national organization, but instead decided to push for a change in its policy on transgender students. On November 8, 2016, the Delta chapter issued a public statement regarding the chapter's division. </p><p>The efforts of the remaining members of the Delta chapter garnered the attention of Alpha Omicron Pi International; in 2015, the organization formed a Gender Identity Committee, which distributed an online survey to all chapters in order to gain a better understanding of how members viewed gender, and discuss possible changes to gender-identity policies. In 2017, the Alpha Omicron Pi International Diversity Policy and Bylaws were amended to add a non-discrimination clause for "other characteristics protected by state or federal law. Membership is open to women and those who identify as women." According to Delta chapter members, official fraternity documents were also amended to remove micro-aggressions in language, including terms such as "colonizing." </p><p>On December 11, 2017, the national Executive Board of Alpha Omicron Pi withdrew the Delta chapter's charter, citing "the chapter's inability to 'build their membership to sustain a viable AOII membership experience.'" Members were invited to affiliate with the Boston AOII Alumnae Chapter. In May of 2018, remaining residents moved out of the Delta chapter's sorority house at 25 Whitfield Road in Somerville. </p>  </bioghist>
