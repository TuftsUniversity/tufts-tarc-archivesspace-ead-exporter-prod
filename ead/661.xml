<p>After Gill's death in 2007, Digital Collections and Archives (DCA) staff packed up his office in East Hall and moved items to the East Hall basement. Lawyers for Ayanna Gill packed up personal materials for return to her at the same time. One of Gill's previous offices had been packed up by the History Department at an unknown point in the past and had also been stored in the East Hall basement. DCA also packed up books and manuscripts in Gill's apartment. Materials now in Box 50, including a manuscript for <title render="italic">Dissent, Discontent, and Disinterest: Afro-American Opposition to the United States Wars of the 20th Century</title> and editor's comments were brought to DCA by Susanne Belovari, Archivist for Reference and Collections, in 2007. The remaining materials stayed in the East Hall basement until a deed of gift was signed in September 2016 and the materials were delivered to DCA by Personal Movers on October 18, 2016. Two further accruals, of five and four boxes, were transferred to DCA on November 29, 2016 and December 13, 2016 by Dan Santamaria, University Archivist, and Adrienne Pruitt, Collections Management Archivist.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Gerald R. Gill papers consist primarily of professional papers relating to his career as a professor of American history at Tufts University (1980-2007). His papers include correspondence, research and subject files, teaching materials, records of university service, and writings. The collection also includes biographical materials, audiovisual materials, photographs, and objects.  Photographs chiefly document black student life at Tufts, the bulk apparently sent to Gill by black alumni. There are also photographs of Gill, often at university events. Audiovisual materials include black alumni oral histories. Digital files include student papers, teaching materials, event programs and fliers, and university memos.</p><p>Research and subject files, teaching materials, and writings reveal Gill's research interests, which focused on African-American history. Topics include the history of protest, the civil rights movement, pacifism, American sports history, Boston race relations, and the experience of black faculty, staff, and students at Tufts. Teaching materials contain syllabi, class handouts, course readings, exams, assignments, and papers, some of which consist of oral histories conducted by students about the civil rights movement. Gill's university service records detail his work for many Tufts committees and his extensive undergraduate mentoring and advising duties. The bulk of the materials in this collection date from the 1980s-2007, with a small amount of material from the 1950s-1980s. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Gerald R. Gill (1948-2007) taught American history at Tufts University from 1980-2007. He began as an assistant professor, served as an associate professor beginning in 1987, and became the history department's deputy chair in 1998. He was a leading scholar in the field of African-American history and the history of the civil rights movement. He was also a founding and core member of several interdisciplinary programs at Tufts, including American Studies, Africa in the New World Studies, and Peace and Justice Studies.</p><p>Gill was born on November 18, 1948 in New Rochelle, New York, to Robert and Etta Gill. He received a bachelor's degree in history in 1970 from Lafayette College, where he was one of the founders of Lafayette's Association of Black Collegians and the Black Cultural Center.  He then earned a master's degree in United States history (1974) and a doctorate in history (1985) from Howard University in Washington D.C. A conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, Gill wrote his dissertation on the history of twentieth-century African-American pacifism.</p><p>Gill taught at Howard University (1975-1978), University of the District of Columbia (1978), Harvard University (1979), and UCLA (1986), in addition to Tufts University (1980-2007). He received a number of teaching awards and honors, including Professor of the Year for Massachusetts (twice, in 1995 and 1999); the Lerman-Neubauer Prize for Outstanding Teaching and Advising (1998); the Tufts Community Union Senate's Professor of the Year Award (1999); and the Lillian and Joseph Leibner Award for Distinguished Teaching and Advising (1993). The Distinguished Service Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Tufts Community, bestowed on Gill in 2000 by the university's Africana Center, was renamed the Gerald R. Gill Distinguished Service Award in his honor the same year. He was also awarded research fellowships at the W.E.B. Dubois Institute at Harvard (1979), the Center for Afro-American Studies at U.C.L.A. (1985), and a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship at the Schomberg Center for Research in Black Culture (1997).</p><p>Gill's university service included membership on many committees, particularly those related to undergraduate education and advising. In addition to teaching, mentoring students, and writing, Gill served as a consultant on many public television and documentary projects, including <title render="italic">Eyes on the Prize</title>, <title render="italic">The American Experience</title>, <title render="italic">Africans in America</title>, <title render="italic">This Far by Faith</title>, and <title render="italic">I'll Make Me a World</title>. He was the author of <title render="italic">Meanness Mania: The Changed Mood (1980)</title>, co-authored <title render="italic">The Case for Affirmative Action for Blacks in Higher Education</title> (1978), edited the <title render="italic">Faculty Guide and Student Study Guide for the Eyes on the Prize</title> (1991), and co-edited <title render="italic">The Eyes on the Prize Civil Rights Reader</title> (1991). At the time of his death, he was working on two unpublished books: <title render="italic">Struggling Yet in Freedom's Birthplace: The Civil Rights Movement in Boston, 1935-1972</title>, a history of Boston race relations; and <title render="italic">Dissent, Discontent and Disinterest: Afro-American Opposition to the United States War of the Twentieth Century</title>, an extension of his doctoral dissertation.</p><p>Gill was divorced with one daughter, Ayanna Gill. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 26, 2007.</p>  </bioghist>

Formats include photographic prints, slides, negatives, a film strip, VHS tapes, CDs, audiocassettes, and 45 rpm and 33 1/3 rpm records. 
The audiovisual materials contain a small body of material (two VHS tapes and an audiocassette) that appear to relate to the "Another Light on the Hill" exhibit research. There are nine audiocassettes and related documentation from the Victoria Norman "Black at Tufts" project, which appear to contain oral histories and may also relate to the exhibit.  </p><p>The audiovisual materials also include teaching materials and student projects. There are a number of mix tapes and two audiocassettes with no label; they have not been reviewed and their contents are unknown.</p><p>Photographs primarily document black student life at Tufts in the 1980s-1990s. Correspondence suggests that these photographs were donated by black alumni in an effort to document their time on campus as a part of the "Another Light on the Hill" exhibit. Other materials include photos of Gill at campus events and Gill's professional headshots. Additionally, there are small art prints and a signed photo of Lenny Kravitz.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_0fcbc924a02b47ffe9627ac7c2619887" level="item"><did><unittitle>A.A.

contains correspondence sent or received by Gill. Enclosures and attachments to correspondence include artwork, brochures, CDs, fliers, forms, invitations, photographs, and writings.  The majority of correspondents are Tufts University colleagues, administrators, students, and alumni. The materials in this series reflect Gill's professional activities and personal relationships. </p><p>Significant topics include Gill's involvement in Tufts Black Alumni events, his work on various projects (including <title render="italic">Alaska Highway</title> and <title render="italic">Howard Thurman, In Search of Common Ground</title>), and his membership or association with various national organizations, such as the Golden Key National Honor Society. Current and former students often wrote to Gill, and their correspondence reflects his deep commitment to students and the Tufts community. Correspondence from colleagues and administrators touches on his university service in initiatives like the Tufts Black Caucus. The series also includes invitations to participate in various events, such as seminars held at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston. There is some overlap in subject materials between this series, the Events series, and the University service series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_a0f6bb818ab0f4ade03e7f2511f5a255"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged in two sub-series, Paper mail and Email.

The bulk of the materials consist of newspaper clippings, articles, reference copies, and notes. They cover a wide variety of topics, mostly related to African American history, black Tufts students and alumni, sports history, and American politics. There is a large body of material on the civil rights movement in the United States, which includes a small box of index cards with information about the civil rights movement dating from 1942 to 2007.</p><p>One particularly useful grouping of materials is the Tufts History subject files. These mostly reflect original order and provide insight into Gill's interests on campus. These materials may have been compiled as research for the "Another Light on the Hill" exhibit. There is some overlap in subject matter between this series, the Events series, and Teaching materials.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_baa75d91702e43f4d01c329200d4a332"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged alphabetically by subject.
