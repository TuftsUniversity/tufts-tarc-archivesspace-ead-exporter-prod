    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>James Gould was born on May 14, 1924 in Boulder, Colorado.  He graduated with a Master of Arts from the Fletcher School in 1947, and with a Ph.D. in 1955. In between earning these degrees, Gould served for five years as a foreign service officer in Indonesia and Hong Kong.  Gould then taught at Claremont Men's College as an Associate Professor, as well as at Scripps College, where he became Professor Emeritus in 1989. </p><p>Gould was a lifelong pacifist. At Scripps College, he taught several courses in peace studies which had a strong emphasis on women peacemakers. Gould developed a calendar of birthdates and other significant dates relating to these women, which would later become the Women in Peace website, a database of women peacemakers.  Gould was acknowledged for this with several honors, including the International Courage of Conscience Award by the Peace Abbey Foundation.  Additionally, he was awarded several positions as a lecturer, including acting as a Fulbright lecturer at the University of Munich, a Danforth Faculty Fellow, and a Paul Delp Peace Lecturer at Chapman College.  </p><p>Gould was elected as the class historian of Fletcher's Class of 1947 in the late 1990's. This entailed connecting the Office of Development and Alumni Relations and his classmates, and relaying information to Fletcher alumni publications.
