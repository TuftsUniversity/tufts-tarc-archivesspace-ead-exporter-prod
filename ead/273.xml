    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Funded by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, the National Youth Administration (N.Y.A.) was a New Deal program from June 26, 1935 through September 1943. The program offered courses in reading, writing, and mathematics and ran the Works Project Program training unemployed and out-of-school youth as well as the Student Aid Program paying for work study for students in high schools, colleges, and graduate programs. N.Y.A. programs were open to U.S. citizens between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five who could show financial need. </p>
<p>July 1, 1939 the N. Y. A. was transferred to the Federal Security Agency and in 1942 to the War Manpower Commission, Office of Emergency Management; at the same time all non-war related N. Y. A . efforts were dropped; financial needs was dropped as criteria and some youth centers continued as as War Production Training Centers focusing on national defense training. With mounting critiques by anti-New Dealers, N.Y. A. was shut down in September 1943. Throughout its existence more than 2 million students were employed through the Student Aid Program and more than 2.6 million youth through the Works Projects Program. </p>
<p>The programs were open to women as well as African Americans and was perhaps the most egalitarian of all New Deal programs.</p>  </bioghist>
