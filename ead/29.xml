    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Dame-Coolidge family sent two generations to earn bachelor's degrees at Tufts University. Richard Bradford Coolidge (1879-1957) earned his bachelor's and master's degree in four years from Tufts University in 1902, where he was also a member of Theta Delta Chi, Phi Beta Kappa, and served as editor of The Tuftonian, a student literary magazine. At Tufts, he met Ruth B. Dame. They married in 1908 and had three children. After graduation, he worked briefly as a journalist before attending Harvard Law School and later entering politics. He served on the local Board of Aldermen, in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and finally as Mayor of Medford from 1923 to 1926. He then served as president and director of the First National Bank in Medford until 1950. He was a treasurer of Tufts College from 1934 to 1952 and was elected a lifetime trustee in 1950. He died in 1957. Ruth Burleigh Dame Coolidge (1880-1951) also earned her bachelor's and master's degree in four years from Tufts University in 1902. At Tufts, she was a member of the Tower Cross Society, the Delta Sigma sorority, and Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation she taught in local public schools and wrote articles for magazines and newspapers. She was very active in local civic and historical groups. She died in 1951. William Bradford Coolidge (1916-2010), their second child, was born in 1916 in Medford and attended Tufts College on a Trustees Fellowship from 1933 to 1937. At Tufts, William, called Brad, served as editor of The Tufts Weekly (1936). After graduation, Brad worked as a journalist in East Asia before serving as a foreign language specialist in the U.S. Army. In 1943, he married Jean E. Thoits and they had three children. From 1946 to 1972, Brad served in numerous overseas and domestic posts for the State Department. He died in 2010.</p>  </bioghist>
