<p>Prior to her death, Sarah Moore Field managed and preserved a collection of papers and belongings related to the Field family, including material from her time as a student at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. After her death, the executors of her will, in collaboration with the Trinitarian Congregational Church, donated select objects from the collection to regional museums and historical societies. A portion of the collection was sold to benefit the Trinitarian Congregational Church in North Andover, Massachusetts.</p><p>Material related to Sarah Moore Field's studies at the Museum School were donated by the executors of the Sarah Moore Field estate to the Archives of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1998. The original accession numbers from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Libraries and Archives were 2016-17, March 10, 2016; 2016-22, March 14, 2016; and 2019-16, August 14, 2019.
