    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Deborah Digges (1950-2009) was an American poet, author, and Tufts University associate professor of English from 1986-2009. </p><p>Born on February 6, 1950 in Jefferson City, Missouri to Everett D. Sugarbaker, an oncologist, and Geneva Sugarbaker, a former nurse, Deborah Digges studied at Wheaton College, Illinois, and William Jewell College, Missouri, before marrying Air Force Pilot Charles Digges in 1969. She received a BA in English from the University of California, Riverside in 1976; an MA in English from the University of Missouri-Columbia in 1982; and an MFA in Poetry from the Iowa Writer's Workshop in 1984.</p><p>Digges published several memoirs and books of poetry, including Vesper Sparrows (1986), Late in the Millennium (1989), Fugitive Spring (1992), Rough Music (1995), The Stardust Lounge: Stories From a Boy's Adolescence (2001), and Trapeze (2004). Her work also appeared in The New Yorker. She was the recipient of numerous awards, including the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Prize in 1987, the Pushcart Prize in 1977 and 1994, and the Kingsley Tufts Award in 1996. She was also awarded grants from the National Endowment of the Arts, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, and the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation. Digges taught English at Tufts University from 1986 until her death in 2009. She also taught at Boston University, Columbia University, and New York University. </p><p>Digges was married three times and had five children (including two stepsons and one foster son). Her marriage to Charles Digges ended in divorce in 1980. She married poet Stanley Plumly in 1985, and was divorced in 1993. She married Franklin Loew - former Dean of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University - in 2000. Loew passed away in 2003. Digges committed suicide in Northampton, Massachusetts, on April 10, 2009. </p>  </bioghist>
