    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection contains four audiotapes of interviews and a bound volume of transcribed interviews in Russian and in English. This oral history project was coordinated by David Sloane, Associate Professor of Russian at Tufts University. With students in his third year Russian language class, he identified Soviet Jewish immigrants in the Boston area and had the students conduct oral history interviews. The interviews were transcribed and proofread by the students and interviewees. Though the interviews were conducted in Russian, the transcriptions are available in both Russian and English.</p>  </scopecontent>
