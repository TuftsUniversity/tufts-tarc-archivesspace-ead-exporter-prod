    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Lois Gibbs (born 1951) is an environmental activist who formed the Love Canal Homeowners Association after discovering that her entire neighborhood of Love Canal, Niagara Falls, New York, had been built on a toxic waste dump. The organization succeeded against strong opposition by local, state, and federal government agencies, and Occidental Petroleum, and President Carter issued an Emergency Declaration in October 1980 to get 833 families evacuated and Love Canal cleaned up. Lois Gibbs and the association were instrumental in the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund.
In 1980, Gibbs founded the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste, later renamed the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, and served as its executive director. She has published about Love Canal and was the subject of the TV movie, 'Lois Gibbs: the Love Canal Story.'
Gibbs received honorary doctorates from the State University of New York; Cortland College; Haverford College; Green Mountain College; Medaille College; and Tufts University. She has also received numerous awards, including the 1990 Goldman Environmental Prize and the 1998 Heinz Award. She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.
Gibbs sits on numerous Boards and Advisory Committees, and lives in Falls Church, Virginia with her husband, Stephen Lester.</p>  </bioghist>

Materials were removed from MS001 based on a content list found in MS001's documentation folder. </p><p>Preliminary processing of the 2017 accessions was done by Leah Edelman, Records and Accessioning Archivist, in 2017. Materials were placed in archival boxes if the original housing was damaged, and loose materials were placed in folders where needed. Received order was maintained. A box-level inventory and series-level description were created and the finding aid was updated at the time of processing. </p><p>Steven Gentry and Sony Prosper, Archives and Reference Assistants, processed boxes 5 through 33 at the folder-level under the direction of Adrienne Pruitt, Collections Management Archivist, in Summer 2017.
