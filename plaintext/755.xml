    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Center for Reading and Language Research (CRLR) was founded by Dr. Maryanne Wolf in 1994, as an affiliate of the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study and Human Development. The Center's goal was to "pursue knowledge" regarding how the brain learns to read, and how this knowledge could be applied to learning disabilities, especially dyslexia.  Additionally, a central goal of the CRLR was to provide support for children experiencing a "lack of success" in school.  It pursued this goal both by developing new techniques for diagnosing and treating reading barriers, and by developing literacy programs for children in the local communities of Medford, Somerville, and Malden. These included the Tufts Literacy Corps, which was developed in 1997 and employed nearly 100 tutors to work one-on-one with children in reading, writing, and math. Other programs included the Malden Summer Literacy Enrichment Program, which was an intensive four-week reading intervention for severely impaired readers.  Besides supporting young readers, the programs additionally provides undergraduates with the opportunity of civic engagement and experience working with children, often learning "more than an average tutor" due to their grounding in the RAVE-O (Retrieval, Automaticity, Vocabulary, Engagement with Language, Orthography) Program principles.  </p><p>From its founding to its closing, the center was directed by Dr. Maryanne Wolf. Wolf used her time at the center to pioneer several "state-of-the-art intervention techniques" to assist children with reading difficulty.   The center also made use of several grants over the years, including those from the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development.   </p><p>In January of 2018, the Center announced that Dr. Wolf would be retiring from her position as Executive Director, and that the center would close. However, the center diverted several of their programs to be run either independently or by outside organizations in the area. This includes their annual summer reading program, which as of 2018 is being run out of the Speech, Language and Hearing Clinic at Northeastern University</p>  </bioghist>
