    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The bulk of this collection was originally organized by Erin Dornbusch at ACCION in 2012. Initial accessions in Series 001 and 006 were processed at the folder level by Sarah Gustafson in 2013. The remainder of the collection was minimally processed in November 2015 -- March 2016 by Dan Bullman and Rose Oliveira, Archives and Research Assistants, under the supervision of Adrienne Pruitt, Collections Management Archivist.</p>

<p>In MS196.006.006: Communications and External Affairs records - Photographs and audiovisual materials, Some items will require further preservation actions in the future, such as rehousing uncut negatives and loose slides.  An attempt may be made to reformat two decaying film reels (MS196.006.006.086), if they are salvageable.  Duplicate slides and a mousepad were separated for return to the donor.  Two used instant film cameras and one roll of exposed 35mm film were also separated pending further donor decisions.</p>

<p>In MS196.008: Human Resources records, Photograph albums were rehoused in a new box. These could be potentially be disassembled for preservation reasons, if a more granular level of processing is done in the future.</p>

<p>In MS196.009, 1.5 cubic feet of duplicative material was separated from the collection. A half of a box of materials related to the merger between ACCION USA and Peer Partnerships INC., Working Capital was moved from Series 9 to Series 10. This material was determined to be more appropriate in Series 10. This series was processed by Rose Oliveira, Archives and Research Assistant, in January 2016. </p>

<p>In MS196.011: Administrative records, this series was processed by Dan Bullman, Archives and Research Assistant, in February 2016. Some personally identifiable information was found, so a 75 year restriction was applied to the series.</p>

<p>In MS196.012: Strategic planning records, this series was processed by Dan Bullman, Archives and Research Assistant, in February 2016. </p>

<p>Notes from Erin Dornbusch, a former ACCION International intern who worked on this collection, were retained in the analog collection documentation file for MS196.</p>

<p>
Accession MS-2020-049, including administrative, financial, and human resources records in Series 4, 7, and 10, were processed by Records and Accessioning Archivist, Jane Kelly, in Spring 2020.

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>ACCION International was founded in 1961 by Joseph H. Blatchford, a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley Law School. Moved to action by the political upheaval and poverty he saw traveling in Latin America, Blatchford viewed community grassroots development as a way to help improve lives. In 1961, he enlisted the help of two other UC Berkeley students, Jerry Brady and Gary Glenn, to recruit the first class of thirty American volunteers to work on their first projects in Venezuela.</p>

<p>ACCION's initial projects involved improving infrastructure in the community through both fundraising and manual labor such as building schools and digging ditches. They also worked to provide technical support and assistance, enabling local residents to embark on their own projects. Blatchford expanded ACCION with chapters in Brazil, Peru, and New York in the late 1960s. In the first decade of ACCION's existence, the news media frequently made comparisons between the organization and the Peace Corps. Blatchford was appointed Director of the Peace Corps in 1969.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, ACCION sought to address lack of economic opportunity in urban Latin America by establishing a microlending program. In 1973 the ACCION organization UNO (Recife, Brazil), issued its first loans to small, informal enterprises. ACCION's success in microlending led to their subsequent focus on microfinance. From 1980 to 1990, ACCION established microfinance programs in fourteen Latin American and Caribbean countries. In 1984, ACCION created the Latin American Bridge Fund, a guaranteed fund through which ACCION affiliates could secure lines of credit.</p>

<p>The Gran Salto "Great Leap" expansion campaign of the 1990s developed ACCION's programs in the United States as well as extending their reach in Latin America. In 1991, ACCION founded the ACCION U.S. Network to create microfinance programs in the United States. The pilot program was launched in Brooklyn, New York and the program grew steadily across the United States.</p> 

<p>In 1992, ACCION joined with nonprofit microlender PRODEM and other local banks and investors to found BancoSol, the world's first commercial bank focused solely on microfinance, in Bolivia. ACCION established the Gateway Fund to make investments in microfinance institutions worldwide in 1996 and continued to expand its international operations outside the Americas in the 2000s by establishing partnerships with aspiring small business owners in sub-Saharan Africa and India. A partnership with Ecobank led to the founding of EB-Accion Savings and Loans in Ghana in 2007.</p> 

<p>ACCION established the Center for Financial Inclusion (CFI), a think tank dedicated to taking action to ensure broad access to financial services, in 2008.  CFI has collaborated with microfinance experts, financial advisers, banking institutions, investors, and a number of other stakeholders to achieve its goals of financial inclusion.</p>

sub-series contains photographic prints, negatives, slides, film reels, video and audiotapes, and digital photographs documenting ACCION International's activities worldwide.  The bulk of the materials date from 1980 to 2005.  Most of this sub-series focuses on ACCION's microfinance programs in Latin American countries, but there are also photographs from Africa and India.  Of particular note are ACCION's delegations sent to countries such as Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.  Additionally, there are a number of photographs of ACCION's foreign microfinance institutions (MFIs), such as Bancosol in Bolivia and Banco Solidario in Ecuador, and their clientele.</p>

<p>Also included are a number of photographs of ACCION staff members, social gatherings, events, and fundraisers.  There are numerous photographs of Maria Otero, who joined ACCION in 1986 and served as President and CEO from 2000 to 2009.</p>

<p>Audiocassettes contain radio interviews, conference sessions (such as the plenary of the 1997 Microcredit Summit), and other ACCION International events such as fundraisers and luncheons.  Of particular interest are materials about the informal economy in Latin America, such as "The Message of the Informal Sector."  Some of the audio is in Spanish.</p>

<p>Videotapes contain ACCION promotional videos, short news segments about ACCION, interviews, and productions about microcredit.</p>

<p>Titles of digital photographs were derived from the file names where possible, and were assigned general titles when file names were not meaningful.</p>

The Resource Development Office oversaw the cultivation and stewardship of giving from individuals, foundations, and corporate institutions as well as grants from governments and multinational institutions. The bulk of the materials date from 1985 to 2005 and document the many projects and programs ACCION proposed and implemented with the support of various people, foundations, and agencies. For example, the 1991 Gran Salto Expansion Campaign, which expanded ACCION's programs in Latin America and the United States, is documented in this series. 
Major partners include the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), a government agency that provided grant support to ACCION's projects, especially in Latin America, and the International Finance Group (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group. Of note is a memorandum on Maria Otero's 1999 meeting with Hillary Clinton in Bolivia (see MS196.007.049), which includes a letter from Hillary Clinton.</p>

Launched in 2008, The Center for Financial Inclusion is an action-oriented think tank that collaborates with key industry partners to address challenges to global financial inclusion. The bulk of the materials are publications dating from 1989 to 2000 that address best practices, research, training, and policy guidance on microenterprise development worldwide. These publications were produced by ACCION International, ACCION U.S. Network, and the Center for Financial Inclusion, as well as partner organizations including the Microfinance Network, Calmeadow, and the United States Agency for International Development's Growth and Equity through Microenterprise Investments and Institutions (GEMINI) project. The GEMINI series includes a run of working papers and technical reports. Working papers runs from 2 to 50 and are missing 1, 14, 40, and 43.  The technical reports run from 1-83 and are missing 1, 5, 63, 68-71, 77. </p>
<p>Also of interest are course materials from a joint program between ACCION and the Harvard Business School on strategic leadership for microfinance. The course materials include annotations by Maria Otero, president and CEO of ACCION from 2000 to 2009. Files created by Cathy Quense, ACCION CFO from 1996 to 2008, include CFI publications and annual reports.</p> <p>Materials are in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. </p>

statistics, advisory reports, presentations, transparencies, guidebooks, correspondence, memoranda, meeting minutes, notes, reports, business plans, newsletters, clippings, articles, and pamphlets created by ACCION's Global Program division. Global Programs provides financial tools including microloans, business training, and other financial services to microfinance institutions (MFIs). Global Programs partners are MFIs in Latin America, the United States, China, India, and Africa. The bulk of the materials range from 1985 to 2008 and documents the development of ACCION's partnerships, primarily in Latin America and the United States.</p>
<p>The subseries document many areas of interest. Partner information contains MFI information from its Latin American program partners. This includes correspondence, reports, plans, bulletins, newsletters, clippings, and articles. The bulk of the material pertains to BancoSol, the first commercial bank in the world dedicated solely to microenterprise, which ACCION helped to found in Bolivia in 1992. Training materials include manuals and programs developed by ACCION for its MFIs. An example is Dialogo de Gestiones, an educational model geared toward entrepreneurs based on modules used in Central and South America. Planning documents and presentations include information on microfinance, business plans, and proposals for its MFIs.  Also of interest are Red Books, ACCION International's yearly reporting of statics, which span the years 1985 to 1997, and advisory reports of its Latin American programs, many of which pertain to Colombia.</p>
<p>Files were created by Carlos Castello, head of Global Programs (2006-2016); Susana Barton, vice president and program manager (2004-2012); and Cathy Quense, ACCION CFO (1996 to 2008).</p>
<p>Materials are in Spanish, English, and Portuguese.</p>

The bulk of the material ranges from 1987 to 1999 and represents an internal annual conference for ACCION directors.

The name of this conference varied over time, from the Conferencia de Personal in the 1980s, to the Conferencia de Directores from the early 1990s on, to Conferencia de Directores de la Red ACCION beginning in 1999. </p>  
<p>Also represented in this series is the Microfinance Network conference, with participants from several microfinance companies.
