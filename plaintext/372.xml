    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Bernhard Gottlieb (1886-1950) was born in Kuty, Austria (later Czechoslovakia) on July 17, 1886. He was a leading figure in the field of oral histology in dentistry. </p><p>Dr. Bernhard Gottlieb received his Doctor of Medicine degree from University of Vienna and his Doctorate in Medical Dentistry from University of Bonn in Germany. He belonged to a group of Viennese scientists who built the scientific foundations for the clinical sciences of periodontics, orthodontics, pedodontics, endodontics, and oral surgery. After the annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938, Gottlieb left for Palestine, where he worked to build up the dental profession. He immigrated to the United States in 1940, where he was briefly associated with Columbia University and the University of Michigan before moving to the Baylor College of Dentistry in Dallas. At Baylor, he became a professor and head of the Department of Pathology and Research, where he wrote hundreds of scientific articles and four textbooks. Many consider Gottlieb the father of Oral Histology. </p><p>Gottlieb died March 16, 1950 in Dallas, Texas at the age of 64.</p>  </bioghist>
