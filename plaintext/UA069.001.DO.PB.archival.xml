<p>Since 1955, Tufts University has continued to expand its horizons. In 1964, in one of Wessell's final acts as president, Tufts opened the Experimental College. The Ex-College, which allows students to take classes not normally found in the curriculum, has remained one of Tufts' most popular programs.</p><p>In 1977, Tufts established a five-year joint degree program with the New England Conservatory of Music. Soon after, in 1979, a similar program began with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Also in 1979, the Tufts Center for European Studies in Talloires, France, was established in an 11th Century priory. The Tufts European Center began operation soon after.</p><p>In late 1979, Tufts made another important addition. In October, the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine opened at its original Boston campus. In 1980, the Grafton campus, built on the site of a state mental hospital, officially opened its doors.</p><p>The last two major additions to Tufts University took place in 1980 and 1981. In 1980, the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, established with a large grant from the Sackler family, opened its doors on the Boston campus of the Tufts School of Medicine. In 1981, at the Medford Campus, Tufts celebrated the opening of the School of Nutrition Science and Policy. The school was the first of its kind in the nation.</p><p>Since Tufts College was officially established in 1852, it has continued to grow and expand in new directions. From its beginnings as a small liberal arts college through its expansion into a full-scale university, Tufts has maintained a strong academic tradition and a community feel.</p>  </bioghist>

Three features fundamentally characterize a successful digital library design: finer granularity of collection objects, automated processes, and decentralized community contributions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Repurposable digital objects</subject><subject source="local">Automated textual analysis</subject><subject source="local">Customization</subject><subject source="local">Personalization</subject><subject source="local">User contributions</subject><subject source="local">Greco-Roman collections</subject><subject source="local">Perseus Digital Library</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d1ebb068b387feb42514ddd877f78006" level="item"><did><unittitle>ePhilology: When the Books Talk to Their Readers</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jones, Alison</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bamman, David</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f2cfa8ddd9140602844927aaabc8f504"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_ac5a3338b88b782ba822122bbf9bf278"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Crane, Gregory, David Bamman, and Alison Babeu.

Philology here implies that language and literature are the objects of study but assumes that language and literature must draw upon the full cultural context and thus sees in philological analysis a starting point for the scientia totius antiquitatis - the systematic study of all ancient culture. The term ePhilology implicitly states that, while our strategic goal may remain the scientia totius antiquitatis, the practices whereby we pursue this strategic goal must evolve into something qualitatively different from the practices of the past.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Text processing (Computer Science)</subject><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Humanities computing</subject><subject source="local">Classical scholarship</subject><subject source="local">Electronic philology</subject><subject source="local">Personalization</subject><subject source="local">Customization</subject><subject source="local">Language technologies</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_aaf8d9dc96aa7b0e7c17f33363452d56" level="item"><did><unittitle>Perseus: An Interactive Curriculum on Classical Greek Civilization, A Proposal to the Annenberg/CPB Project</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mylonas, Elli</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Martin, Thomas</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nagy, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Heinrichs, Albert</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hemans, Frederick</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Morell, Kenneth</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Marchionini, Gary</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, D.

The primary sources of their studies are often physically inaccessible and difficult to assimilate. In Perseus, therefore, we have begun to use the technology of interactive computing and the dense storage capacity of optical disk to create a vast, highly cross-referenced database of textual and visual information, and to experiment with ways to let the user explore this information. Perseus promotes active learning and, we believe, has already begun to alter the three-way relationship between teacher, student, and source material.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Greece-Civilization-To 146 B.

This paper reports the results from an analysis of OCR-generated text for classical Greek source texts. Classicists have depended upon specialized manual keyboarding that costs two or more times as much as keyboarding of English both for accuracy and because classical Greek OCR produced no usable results. We found that we could 			produce texts by OCR that, in some cases, approached the 99.95% professional data entry accuracy rate. In most cases, OCR-generated text yielded results that, by including the variant readings that digital corpora traditionally have left out, provide better recall and, we argue, can better serve many scholarly needs than the expensive corpora upon which classicists have relied for a generation. As digital collections expand, we will be able to collate multiple editions against each other, identify quotations of primary sources, and provide a new generation of services.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">OCR evaluation</subject><subject source="local">Ancient Greek</subject><subject source="local">Text alignment</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_70e7980ddb8d7aa86c140c2cb43636c6" level="item"><did><unittitle>The Challenge of Virginia Banks: An Evaluation of Named Entity Analysis in a 19th Century Newspaper Collection</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jones, Alison</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2006/2006">2006</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b97a73b530cd692f108d5d4d1b10e42b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_d34b3f9e934103a5590e9ea2d6191cf6"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Crane, Gregory, and Alison Jones.

This paper analyzes success with ten categories of entities prominent in these newspapers and the particular problems that these classes of named entities raise. Personal and place names are familiar but some more important categories (such as ship names and military units) illustrate  some of the challenges that named entity identification confronts as it evolves into a fundamental tool not only for automatic metadata generation but also for searching and browsing as well. We conclude by suggesting the kinds of knowledge sources that digital libraries need to assemble as part of their machine readable reference collections to support named entity identification as a core service.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Named entity recognition</subject><subject source="local">Historical newspapers</subject><subject source="local">Automatic metadata generation</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3c5e2271958e126798a9fbb45e398d12" level="item"><did><unittitle>eScience and the Humanities</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Babeu, Alison</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bamman, David</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_c52ea2e5a5c0db0eae4bda315ec43b33"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_b72268d0d8e0f23cbad2ea82091d40ec"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Crane, Gregory, David Bamman and Alison Babeu.

Like scientists, humanists have electronic sources and datasets that are too large for traditional labor intensive analysis.

Unlike their colleagues in the sciences, however, humanists  have relatively few resources with which to develop this new infrastructure. They must therefore systematically cultivate alliances with better funded disciplines, learning how to build on emerging infrastructure from other disciplines and, where possible, contributing to the design of a cyberinfrastructure that serves all of academia, including the humanities</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Cyberinfrastructure</subject><subject source="local">Humanities computing</subject><subject source="local">eScience</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d6111e237f96abef62ce6671021c99c5" level="item"><did><unittitle>eCulture, Cyberinfrastructure, Virtual Research Environments and the Cultural Heritage of the Maghreb</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_29c79b703ac7211df1107e9ce313f64a"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_d571435acb9bd29b6d39ce36d0e9c8f8"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Crane, Gregory.

This paper emerges from a July 2002 conference about lexica and few would be willing to argue that classicists could not improve upon the foundations left to us by Liddell, Scott, Jones, and the others who labored on our shared Greek-English Lexicon. But simply because we could improve upon what we already have does not tell us what we should build now. We do not need a better nineteenth-century lexicon. We do not even need the best possible twentieth-century lexicon. We need to develop lexicographic resources to serve non-lexicographic readers of the twenty-first century.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Humanities computing</subject><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Classical scholarship</subject><subject source="local">Electronic philology</subject><subject source="local">Language technologies</subject><subject source="local">Treebanks</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_942c104e8084916eaadc51f43b76e412" level="item"><did><unittitle>Drudgery and Deep Thought: Designing Digital Libraries for the Humanities</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Chavez, Robert F.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rydberg-Cox, Jeffrey A.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Milbank, Thomas L.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, David A.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mahoney, Anne</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bcfba019ca93e7188fcf86f0e4269cea"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_b8fa1e74c5960209e01c6d65194846e5"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Crane, Gregory, Robert F.

At the Perseus Project, we have seen the rise of a new combination of skills. The "Corpus Editor" manages a collection of materials that are thematically coherent and focused but are too large to be managed solely with the labor-intensive techniques of traditional editing. The corpus editor must possess a degree of domain specific knowledge and technical expertise that virtually no established graduate training provides. This new position poses a challenge to humanists as they train and support members of the field pursuing new, but necessary tasks.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Hypertext systems</subject><subject source="local">Corpora (Linguistics)</subject><subject source="local">Quality indicators</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_54517bfb81cb8c7414fd62d307f6af2c" level="item"><did><unittitle>Document Quality Indicators and Corpus Editions</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00013</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rydberg-Cox, Jeffrey A.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mahoney, Anne</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_98c0350fb4a94877ebb5771d836816a1"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_fdfcd4c4617fbe14b6755fa9cb0927f0"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Rydberg-Cox, Jeffrey A., Anne Mahoney, and Gregory Crane.

While electronic documents are still quite new, we now have enough experience to speak with something other than anticipation, whether fretful or eager, about how print and electronic media complement one another. This discussion will focus on one particular reference work:  the entire text of the Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek English Lexicon (9th edition 1940) has been available on the World Wide Web since the fall of 1995. Between July 9, 1996 and August 20, 1997, the electronic lexicon was accessed 336,649 times, with usage growing steadily (as I write in August 1997, the lexicon 	is used more than 1,000 times each day).</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Electronic lexicons</subject><subject source="local">Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon</subject><subject source="local">Greek language, Hellenistic (300 B.C.-600 A.D.)</subject><subject source="local">Text Encoding Initiative</subject><subject source="local">Ancient Greek</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_612381290a8e6a817f5f1f3c9c70f606" level="item"><did><unittitle>Building a Digital Library: The Perseus Project as a Case Study in the Humanities</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00015</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><unitdate normal="1996/1996">1996</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f5aeff58b763d10a7320befb2e4dfa23"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_868fae7b93eefa2e4ff936d77e5e7323"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Crane, Gregory.

The London collection contained far more dense and precise information than the materials from the Greco-Roman world on which we had previously concentrated. The London collection thus allowed us to explore new problems of data structure, manipulation, and visualization. This paper contrasts our model for how humanities digital libraries are best used with the assumptions that underlie many academic digital libraries on the one hand and more literary hypertexts on the other. Since encoding guidelines such as those from the TEI provide collection designers with far more options than any one project can realize, this paper describes what structures we used to organize the collection and why. We particularly emphasize the importance of mining historical "authority lists" (encyclopedias, gazetteers, etc.) and then generating automatic "span-to-span" links within the collection.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Cultural heritage</subject><subject source="local">Automatic linking</subject><subject source="local">London (England)</subject><subject source="local">Collection development (Libraries)</subject><subject source="local">Authority files (Information retrieval)</subject><subject source="local">Document design</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_59d32d2026924a3e2ca697840efee1ca" level="item"><did><unittitle>Towards a Cultural Heritage Digital Library</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.001.00019</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Wulfman, Clifford E.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cerrato, Lisa</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mahoney, Anne</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Milbank, Thomas L.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rydberg-Cox, Jeffrey A.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, David A.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">York, Christopher</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_fcf8752ccd7a783ffc24827326f4ad2e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_0e2c9e689431d7d13059c9944e7dde66"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Crane, Gregory, Clifford E.

The focus of our work is on using these tools to digitize Latin texts. Many of the texts in the language, especially the early modern, make heavy use of special characters like ligatures and accented abbreviations. Current OCRs are inadequate for our purpose: their built-in training sets do not include all these special characters, and further, post-processing of OCR output is based on data and methods specific to the domain language, most of the current systems do not implement error-correction tools for Latin. This abstract outlines the development of a document recognition system for medieval and early modern Latin texts. We first evaluate the performance of the open source OCR framework, Gamera, on these manuscripts. We then incorporate language modeling functions to sharpen the character recognition output.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Latin language</subject><subject source="local">Optical character recognition</subject><subject source="local">Document recognition</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_532d4922968e70c6e92237a8e7d5366b" level="item"><did><unittitle>What Did We Do With a Million Books?

already challenged students of these languages to move away from books as organizing metaphors and to ask, instead, what do you do
with a billion, or even a trillion, words? We need a new culture of intellectual production in which student researchers and citizen scholars play a central role. And we need as a consequence to
reorganize the education that we provide in the humanities, stressing participatory learning, and supporting a virtuous cycle where students contribute data as they learn and learn in order to
contribute knowledge. We report on five strategies that we have implemented to further this virtuous cycle: (1) reading environments by which learners can work with languages that they
have not studied, (2) feedback for those who choose to internalize knowledge about a particular language, (3) methods whereby those with knowledge of different languages can collaborate to develop interpretations and to produce new annotations, (4) dynamic reading lists that allow learners to assess and to document what they have mastered, and (5) general e-portfolios in which learners can track what they have accomplished and document what they have contributed and learned to the public or to particular groups.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_6e678195ca9c62a90cd5b9a764b72929" level="item"><did><unittitle>Guidelines for the Synactic Annotation of Latin Treebanks (Draft)</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.002.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bamman, David</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Passarotti, Marco</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Raynaud, Savina</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2007/2007">2007</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_b7c6a4377b85533cb69dc45f61218265"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_c5bf41e6a8103501e47a0fd9e6693a0b"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Bamman, David, Marco Passarotti, Gregory Crane, and Savina Raynaud.

This is promising news for low-resource languages and digital collections seeking to leverage a small human investment into much larger gain.

Language has been an impenetrable barrier  we can reach any point on the globe in a matter of hours but the amount of time required to master a new language remains unchanged. We can, however, now begin to work with far more languages than we could ever study, much less master. We are now in a position to pursue broader questions and to pursue these with greater rigor than would have been possible in print. A great deal of work remains to be done, however, for very large collections are not scientific corpora and need extensive processing, and many written sources do not yet lend themselves to optical character recognition. Simply scaling up existing systems to analyze millions of books poses software engineering challenges. Perhaps most important of all, we need to train a new generation of researchers who can bridge the intellectual gaps between the relevant computational methods and new research for social, behavioral and economic sciences.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bd7dfa03d344eb1f0e18c35e87225599" level="item"><did><unittitle>Cataloging for a Billion Word Library of Greek and Latin</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.003.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Babeu, Alison L.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Almas, Bridget.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Cerrato, Lisa.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Krohn, Anna.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Baumgart, Frederik.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Berti, Monica.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Franzini, Greta.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Stoyanova, Simona.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_01548a4e752193582f1f1bb38bdc9e51">This paper reports work on a catalog that includes not only standard metadata but also a complete reference transcription for each work so that users can explicitly cite not only every version but also every word in every version of a work. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records conceptual model (FRBR) allows us to move beyond printed books and to track the logical units within (and often across) printed books: works (e.g., the Iliad) and&#13;
                                expressions (e.g., versions such as the 10th century Venetus A manuscript or Butler's English translation). The Canonical Text Services (CTS) Data Model builds upon FRBR, allowing us to cite each word in any version of a text and to do so by building upon established citation schemes inherited from print (e.g., the chapter/verse citation scheme in the Bible). This paper describes a concrete implementation of such a catalogue of 3,679 Greek and Latin works that&#13;
                                includes FRBR inspired metadata and TEI XML transcriptions that were revised to facilitate implementing a CTS API. It also describes how all the different versions of a work can be serialized as variations on the reference version. The FRBR+CTS catalog provides data by which text reuse and alignment services can automatically detect different versions of and quotations from the reference text, aligning all discovered instances according to a canonical citation&#13;

Without a doubt, the addition of spatial dimension to customary 2D web graphics can be visually gripping. But greater potential for the technology lies beyond its ability to command attention. Web 3D presents students and scholars alike with a new tool for visualizing and understanding ancient sites. Fundamentally, 3D digital reconstruction allows architecture, sculpture, and other remains to be considered in their respective contexts as a whole, rather than as individual items divorced from their intended settings. At the same time, digital reconstruction can incorporate a distinction between the "real" and the "hypothetical" just as found in other types of modern restoration work. The Perseus Project is currently preparing 3D models of various archaeological sites. These will be linked to other related materials already in its digital library: maps; plans; photographs; QTVR walkthroughs; site, architecture, and object catalogs; and literary and historical documents. In part, the models are intended as databases of geographic and architectural information in their own right. They are also intended to serve as the underpinning for a contextual presentation of architectural and freestanding sculptures. This paper surveys Perseus' work on the Apollo sanctuary at Delphi. It addresses both the process of digital modeling and the method used to integrate the model with Perseus' existing tools and databases.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">XML (Document markup language)</subject><subject source="local">VRML (Computer program language)</subject><subject source="local">Archaeology</subject><subject source="local">3D graphic standards</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4f39d43f75dfa8e4a45a6fa488bfa81b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Extracting Geometry from Digital Models in a Cultural Heritage Digital Library</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.004.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Milbank, Thomas L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2003/2003">2003</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_cd6f2f36c24affb60c7ab54b1d4f5c92"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_6f546b693e6249bab7f5549c7542fc14"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Milbank, Thomas L.

For narrative documents, questions of \what happened? where? and when?" are natural points of entry. Building on our earlier work at the Perseus Project with detecting terms, place names, and dates, we have exploited co-occurrences of dates and place names to detect and describe likely events in document collections. We compare statistical measures for determining the relative significance of various events. We have built interfaces that help users preview likely regions of interest for a given range of space and time by plotting the distribution and relevance of various collocations. Users can also control the amount of collocation information in each view. Once particular collocations are selected, the system can identify key phrases associated with each possible event to organize browsing of the documents themselves.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Visualization</subject><subject source="local">Information extraction</subject><subject source="local">Interactive information retrieval</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_effce1e8f7cb576dfbd1a838fbba7234" level="item"><did><unittitle>Disambiguating Geographic Names in a Historical Digital Library</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.006.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, David A.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2001/2001">2001</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_bf07cda4393b1241f38b781db42cb9c4"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_a0560b7c4759af59ee4b4c87ec00ad29"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Smith, David A., and Gregory Crane.

Given the fact that the information in each of their databases is of interest to a large community of people, efforts to overcome the current lack of data integration have to be made. Aside from the philosophical implications and the mathematical background involved, the main concern of this project will be the practicability of a software implementation of all relevant concepts using basic Semantic Web technologies as described by the W3C, along with an investigation of the usability of the CIDOC CRM for a multilingual interface. The main purpose of the implementation process is to get a deeper understanding of the concepts and technologies involved when dealing with the Semantic Web, ontologies in general and the CIDOC CRM in particular. For the process of implementation it is essential that software tools team up with a methodical process, and that appropriate tools be discovered or developed and documented. Functional requirements have a tendency to evolve relatively rapidly when information systems are used by historians. Information systems in the humanities are especially confronted with the problem of constant change through the acquisition of new project partners carrying new and varied source material. As a consequence, potential integration efforts have to cope with changes of the database schemas and therefore should be flexible.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">CIDOC-CRM</subject><subject source="local">Data integration</subject><subject source="local">Ontologies (Information retrieval)</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_2f16723b22a0e7b7aa892318b8b1f39b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Managing Authority Lists for Customized Linking and Visualization: A Service for the National STEM Digital Library</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.008.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Colati, Gregory</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2002/2002">2002</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2626514e1bfb850523691eea194298ed"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_788bffde724573df3cb070e393e05d5d"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Colati, Gregory.

First, we will provide automatic linking services that automatically bind key words and phrases to supplementary information. Such automatic linking services are already in place in the Perseus Digital Library. These services will help students, professionals outside a particular discipline, and the interested public to read documents full of unfamiliar technical terms and concepts. Astronomy students and curious amateurs may need to see expansions of some acronyms, e.g., MACHO: massive compact halo object, such as neutron stars and brown dwarfs,  or pictures of Kuiper belt objects. These services can be of particular help to undergraduates as they shift from textbooks to scientific literature: the student struggling with research papers on bioluminescence, for example, will be able to locate information about particular chemical processes or relevant species of echinoderms. Second, we will base automatic linking on authority control of names and terms and on links among different authority lists such as thesauri, glossaries, encyclopedias, subject hierarchies, and object catalogues.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Digital libraries</subject><subject source="local">Automatic linking</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname><corpname source="local">National Science Digital Library</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d139ad45d860d17eb19915409724c953" level="item"><did><unittitle>Vocabulary Building in the Perseus Digital Library</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.009.00001</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Rydberg-Cox, Jeffrey A.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Mahoney, Anne</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2002/2002">2002</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_831dd5f9aa849829facc4ae632c864a2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_5f079ae557aecb081282debeb52f0640"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Rydberg-Cox, Jeffrey A., and Anne Mahoney.

The design approach presented in the paper combines a knowledge domain analysis conducted through semantic spaces with the integration of well established ontologies and the application of ontology design patterns. After briefly describing the specific meaning of "fragment" in a literary context, the paper gives insights into the main conceptual issues of the ontology design process. Lastly, it outlines the overall architecture of protocols, services and data repositories which is required to implement a digital edition of fragments based on the proposed ontology.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Ontologies (Information retrieval)</subject><corpname source="local">Perseus Project</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_0998c50e91b05381dabef4feb8d1febb" level="item"><did><unittitle>When Printed Hypertexts Go Digital: Information Extraction from the Parsing of Indices</unittitle><unitid>PB.001.012.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Romanello, Matteo</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Berti, Monica</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Babeu, Alison</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Crane, Gregory</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2009">2009</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f335f147e45168bc5f9d7bc5e9e1da60"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_b61a4831d18c73d5b6a88b7ba7c76f6b"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Romanello, Matteo, Monica Berti, Alison Babeu, and Gregory Crane.

It offers a glimpse into the subject to entice first year students and to edify nonmajors. Instructors, however, are left with the task of attempting to contextualize and explain works to their Greekless and Latinless students without the aid of the original language to differentiate ideas. It is certainly possible to cover large concepts, such as _____. If, however, the word "anger"&#13;
                                appears past the first line of the Iliad, how is a student to know if it represents _____ or something else which should impact their understanding the passage? Similarly, if given two different translations of the same text, how can a student judge the relative merit of those translations without knowledge of the original? In an academic environment where undergraduates are being encouraged to conduct original research earlier, educators can not simply provide&#13;
                                translations minus understanding of the original language without robbing their students of vital information that could spur them on to further work. This paper documents a class wherein we attempted to bridge the gap between the translations and Greek texts. Our goal was not only to introduce our students to the works and the world where they originated but to also provoke critical thought and allow our students to engage directly with the original texts. Using&#13;
                                a series of three projects, we demonstrated to the students how they could tackle and begin to understand an unfamiliar language via tools freely available on the internet. Based on our experiences teaching this class and reactions gathered from our students, we propose a new potential model for literature in translation courses.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_86ab76175b115292483a805163a0d460"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_d3f794082617b7582d30fa25477f3ff0"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Anna Krohn, Gregory Crane.

OCW content can provide a supplement to curricula available in resource-rich settings, as well as provide much of the basic content critical to teaching and research in resource-limited health education environments. Educational institutions worldwide have the opportunity to explore how OCW and other open tools and materials can supplement efforts to build health education capacity to address global shortages of healthcare workers. Tufts University has worked to leverage open, digital resources to support medical education since 1994 with the creation of the Tufts University Sciences Knowledgebase (TUSK). This experience has yielded vital lessons for institutions interested in OCW, including: effectively motivating faculty participation; managing the inherent complexity of open publishing of health sciences content due to its rapidly evolving nature and reliance on copyrighted materials; generating support through internal and external communication throughout the process; and creating institutional systems that ensure the long-term sustainability of OCW initiatives.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Internet in education</subject><subject source="local">Distance education</subject><subject source="local">Computer-assisted instruction</subject><corpname source="local">Tufts OpenCourseWare</corpname><corpname source="local">Office of the Provost</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_bf820caa84db5e8ee2ad963a3d02dfd2" level="item"><did><unittitle>Analytical modeling of degradation product partitioning kinetics in source zones containing entrapped DNAPL</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00002</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Ramsburg, C.

Assessment of the importance of degradation product sequestration, however, requires accurate description of the mass transfer kinetics. Partitioning kinetics of cis-DCE were assessed in a series of transport experiments conducted in sandy columns containing uniformly entrapped tetrachloroethene (PCE)-nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPL). Effluent data from these experiments were simulated using an analytical solution adapted from the sorption literature. The solution permits interrogation of the relative importance of mass transfer resistance in the aqueous phase and NAPL. Column data and simulations suggest that the kinetic exchange of cis-DCE may be described with mass transfer correlations developed for the dissolution of pure component NAPLs. Diffusive transport within the entrapped ganglia was relatively fast, offering limited resistance to mass exchange. These results (1) establish the applicability of dissolution-based mass transfer correlations for modeling both absorption and dissolution of degradation products, (2) quantify the thermodynamic driving force for the partitioning of cis-DCE in PCE-NAPL by assessing the ternary phase behavior, and (3) guide incorporation and deployment of partitioning kinetics into multiphase compositional simulators when assessing or designing metabolic reductive dechlorination within DNAPL source zones. While focus is placed on examining degradation product partitioning in DNAPL source zones, results may also be useful when considering rate limitations in other liquid-liquid partitioning processes, such as partitioning tracer tests.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Bioremediation</subject><subject source="local">Groundwater--Quality</subject><corpname source="local">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_f2c6c6ad687ec64455a35f34470b73a4" level="item"><did><unittitle>Evolution of a Major Drug Metabolizing Enzyme Defect in the Domestic Cat and Other Felidae: Phylogenetic Timing and the Role of Hypercarnivory</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00003</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Court, Michael H.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Shrestha, Binu</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Reed, J.

This idiosyncrasy results from pseudogenization of the gene encoding UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6, the major species-conserved phenol detoxification enzyme. Here, we established the phylogenetic timing of disruptive UGT1A6 mutations and explored the hypothesis that gene inactivation in cats was enabled by minimal exposure to plant-derived toxicants. Fixation of the UGT1A6 pseudogene was estimated to have occurred between 35 and 11 million years ago with all extant Felidae having dysfunctional UGT1A6. Out of 22 additional taxa sampled, representative of most Carnivora families, only brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea) and northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) showed inactivating UGT1A6 mutations. A comprehensive literature review of the natural diet of the sampled taxa indicated that all species with defective UGT1A6 were hypercarnivores (>70% dietary animal matter). Furthermore those species with UGT1A6 defects showed evidence for reduced amino acid constraint (increased dN/dS ratios approaching the neutral selection value of 1.0) as compared with species with intact UGT1A6. In contrast, there was no evidence for reduced amino acid constraint for these same species within UGT1A1, the gene encoding the enzyme responsible for detoxification of endogenously generated bilirubin. Our results provide the first evidence suggesting that diet may have played a permissive role in the devolution of a mammalian drug metabolizing enzyme. Further work is needed to establish whether these preliminary findings can be generalized to all Carnivora.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Drug tolerance</subject><subject source="local">Phenols</subject><subject source="local">Carnivora</subject><corpname source="local">Department of Molecular Physiology and Pharmacology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_92923c10557d77d2909c68f5e9041206" level="item"><did><unittitle>Multiresolution Decomposition Schemes Using the Parameterized Logarithmic Image Processing Model with Application to Image Fusion</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00004</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Nercessian, Shahan C.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Panetta, Karen A.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Agaian, Sos S.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_5e7ee0ffe26985e1c382a2d9f7fa896f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_e68dff7130a70c4d51465028fcd64905"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Nercessian, Shahan C., Karen A.

A mathematical analysis shows that the Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) model and standard mathematical operators are extreme cases of the PLIP model operators. Moreover, the PLIP model operators also have the ability to take on cases in between LIP and standard operators based on the visual requirements of the input images. PLIP-based multiresolution decomposition schemes are developed and thoroughly applied for image fusion as analysis and synthesis methods. The new decomposition schemes and fusion rules yield novel image fusion algorithms which are able to provide visually more pleasing fusion results. LIP-based multiresolution image fusion approaches are consequently formulated due to the generalized nature of the PLIP model. Computer simulations illustrate that the proposed image fusion algorithms using the Parameterized Logarithmic Laplacian Pyramid, Parameterized Logarithmic Discrete Wavelet Transform, and Parameterized Logarithmic Stationary Wavelet Transform outperform their respective traditional approaches by both qualitative and quantitative means. The algorithms were tested over a range of different image classes, including out-of-focus, medical, surveillance, and remote sensing images.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Image processing</subject><subject source="local">Data processing</subject><corpname source="local">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_c8f518fa903ec8e6180e691b8260744e" level="item"><did><unittitle>A Retrospective Assessment of Occupational Exposure to Elemental Carbon in the U.S. Trucking Industry</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00005</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Davis, Mary E.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hart, Jamie E.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Laden, Francine</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Garshick, Eric</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Smith, Thomas J.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_be44d8b02a20f55c8f0c31a089b5caf2"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_27d003055b79b9eb925c9fe29a6f3e26"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Davis, Mary E.

Objectives: We sought to reconstruct exposure to elemental carbon (EC), a marker of diesel and other vehicle exhaust exposure, in a large national cohort of U.S. trucking industry workers.
Methods: We identified the predictors of measured exposures based on a statistical model and used this information to extrapolate exposures across the cohort nationally. These estimates were adjusted for changes in work-related conditions over time based on a previous exposure assessment of this industry, and for changes in background levels based on a trend analysis of historical air pollution data, to derive monthly estimates of EC exposure for each job and trucking terminal combination between 1971 and 2000. Results: Occupational exposure to EC declined substantially over time, and we found significant variability in estimated exposures both within and across job groups, trucking terminals, and regions of the United States. Average estimated EC exposures during a typical work shift ranged from &lt; 1 ?g/m3 in the lowest exposed category in the 1990s to &gt; 40 ?g/m3 for workers in the highest exposed jobs in the 1970s. Conclusions: Our results provide a framework for understanding changes over time in exposure to EC in the U.S. trucking industry. Our assessment should minimize exposure misclassification by capturing variation among terminals and across U.S. regions, and changes over time.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Public Health</subject><subject source="local">Trucking</subject><subject source="local">Air--Pollution</subject><subject source="local">Lungs Cancer</subject><corpname source="local">Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_9c7ebf007b8e45a1e693c025fc5d0fec" level="item"><did><unittitle>Extracellular Heat Shock Protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp90alpha Assist in Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 Activation and Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00006</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sims, Jessica D.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">McCready, Jessica</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Jay, Daniel G.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2062293072ca5cce4b43c5651f166f75"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_d6601e7e7d112969669028fa7dfb78b9"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Sims, Jessica D., Jessica McCready, Daniel G.

Obtaining a better understanding of migration and invasion, two early steps in metastasis, is critical for the development of treatments that inhibit breast cancer metastasis. In a functional proteomic screen for proteins required for invasion, extracellular heat shock protein 90 alpha (Hsp90alpha) was identified and shown to activate matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). The mechanism of MMP-2 activation by Hsp90alpha is unknown. Intracellular Hsp90alpha commonly functions with a complex of co-chaperones, leading to our hypothesis that Hsp90alpha functions similarly outside of the cell. In this study, we show that a complex of co-chaperones outside of breast cancer cells assists Hsp90alpha mediated activation of MMP-2. We demonstrate that the co-chaperones Hsp70, Hop, Hsp40, and p23 are present outside of breast cancer cells and co-immunoprecipitate with Hsp90alpha in vitro and in breast cancer conditioned media. These co-chaperones also increase the association of Hsp90alpha and MMP-2 in vitro. This co-chaperone complex enhances Hsp90alpha-mediated activation of MMP-2 in vitro, while inhibition of Hsp70 in conditioned media reduces this activation and decreases cancer cell migration and invasion. Together, these findings support a model in which MMP-2 activation by an extracellular co-chaperone complex mediated by Hsp90alpha increases breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Our studies provide insight into a novel pathway for MMP-2 activation and suggest Hsp70 as an additional extracellular target for anti-metastatic drug development.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Breast--Cancer</subject><subject source="local">Heat shock proteins</subject><corpname source="local">Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ae73acc56be59df19b460c5736307e14" level="item"><did><unittitle>An International Evaluation of Ultrasound vs. Computed Tomography in the Diagnosis of Appendicitis</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00007</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Weiner, Scott G.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Reich, Betzalel</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Zalut, Todd</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4fc039ad67605b6bda0eaf47dc0dcc9f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_fc717e91dbbbaaed756aa163d35e9666"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Weiner, Scott G., Betzalel Reich, Todd Zalut.

This comparative international study evaluates the performance of CT vs. US in the evaluation of acute appendicitis. Methods: A retrospective chart analysis was conducted at two tertiary care teaching hospitals, one in each country. Adult patients (age 18-99) with an Emergency Department (ED) working diagnosis of appendicitis between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2006 were reviewed. Included patients had at least one imaging study, went to the OR, and had documented surgical pathology results. Results: Of 136 patients in the United States with the ED diagnosis of appendicitis, 79 met inclusion criteria for the CT cohort. Based on pathology, CT had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 95.4-100%). The negative appendectomy rate in patients with positive CT was 0%. Total median ED length of stay was 533 min [IQR (450-632)] and median time from CT order to completion was 184 min [IQR (147-228)]. Of 520 patients in Israel, 197 were included in the US cohort. Based on final pathology, US had a sensitivity of 68.4% (95% CI 61.2-74.8%). The negative appendectomy rate in patients with positive US was 5.5%. The median ED length of stay for these patients was 387 min [IQR (259-571.5)]. Of the patients, 23.4% had subsequent CT scans. Median time from US order to completion was 20 min [IQR (7-49)]. Both time values were p less than 0.001 when compared with CT. We furthermore calculate that a first pass approach of using US first, and then performing a confirmatory CT scan in patients with negative US, would have saved an average of 88.0 minutes per patient in the United States and avoided CT in 65% of patients. Conclusions: Radiologist-operated US had inferior sensitivity and positive predictive value when compared with CT, though was significantly faster to perform, and avoided radiation and contrast in a majority of patients. A first-pass approach using US first and then CT if US is not diagnostic may be desirable in some institutions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Appendicitis--Imaging</subject><subject source="local">Appendicitis--diagnosis</subject><corpname source="local">Department of Emergency Medicine</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_a09f1f75bcc9f45d4e3e0878734f9e3e" level="item"><did><unittitle>Identification of Biochemical Network Modules Based on Shortest Retroactive Distances</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00008</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Lee, Kyongbum</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Sridharan, Gautham Vivek</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Hassoun, Soha</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_f4ef46b5c43f7b021a5719c8fd60aeab"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_d9992b9f1da3e905fcb22e45bcdb809b"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Lee, Kyongbum, Gautham Vivek Sridharan, Soha Hassoun.

While there is general agreement regarding the qualitative properties of a biochemical module, there is no clear consensus on the quantitative criteria that may be used to systematically derive these modules. In this work, we investigate cyclical interactions as the defining characteristic of a biochemical module. We utilize a round trip distance metric, termed Shortest Retroactive Distance (ShReD), to characterize the retroactive connectivity between any two reactions in a biochemical network and to group together network components that mutually influence each other. We evaluate the metric on two types of networks that feature feedback interactions: (i) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and (ii) liver metabolism supporting drug transformation. For both networks, the ShReD partitions found hierarchically arranged modules that confirm biological intuition. In addition, the partitions also revealed modules that are less intuitive. In particular, ShReD-based partition of the metabolic network identified a redox module that couples reactions of glucose, pyruvate, lipid and drug metabolism through shared production and consumption of NADPH. Our results suggest that retroactive interactions arising from feedback loops and metabolic cycles significantly contribute to the modularity of biochemical networks. For metabolic networks, cofactors play an important role as allosteric effectors that mediate the retroactive interactions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Computational biology</subject><corpname source="local">Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_3c458d544059bef6c74d0f0c8f94c4be" level="item"><did><unittitle>Contact Printing of Colloidal Nanocrystal Thin Films for Hybrid Organic/Quantum Dot Optoelectronic Devices</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00009</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Panzer, Matthew J.</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Aidala, Katherine</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Bulovic, Vladimir</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2011/2011">2011</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_ba702001d256da201887e8bb9b3a0f2f"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_cb400ae3537889466121a2859b0be437"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Panzer, Matthew J., Katherine E.

Experimental details regarding the contact printing process are outlined, and the key advantages of this QD deposition method over other commonly encountered techniques are discussed. The use of tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) to effectively characterize QD film morphology both on an elastomeric stamp (before contact printing) and as-transferred to the organic semiconductor receiving film (after contact printing) is also described.

In order to determine which helicases facilitate DNA replication across these barriers, we analyzed fork progression through them in wild-type and mutant yeast cells, using 2-dimensional gel-electrophoretic analysis of the replication intermediates. We show that the Srs2 protein facilitates replication of hairpin-forming CGG/CCG repeats and prevents chromosome fragility at the repeat, whereas it does not affect replication of G-quadruplex forming sequences or a protein-bound repeat. Srs2 helicase activity is required for hairpin unwinding and fork progression. Also, the PCNA binding domain of Srs2 is required for its in vivo role of replication through hairpins. In contrast, the absence of Sgs1 or Pif1 helicases did not inhibit replication through structural barriers, though Pif1 did facilitate replication of a telomeric protein barrier. Interestingly, replication through a protein barrier but not a DNA structure barrier was modulated by nucleotide pool levels, illuminating a different mechanism by which cells can regulate fork progression through protein-mediated stall sites. Our analyses reveal fundamental differences in the replication of DNA structural versus protein barriers, with Srs2 helicase activity exclusively required for fork progression through hairpin structures.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">DNA replication</subject><corpname source="local">Department of Biology</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4c94ea29b2d2114cf12db8ec38cf8d18" level="item"><did><unittitle>Parametric level set reconstruction methods for hyperspectral diffuse optical tomography</unittitle><unitid>PB.002.00011</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Larusson, Fridrik</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Fantini, Sergio</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><persname source="local">Miller, Eric L.</persname></origination><unitdate normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_99e8a94f8402527336b409ee04ff6c10">A parametric level set method (PaLS) is implemented for image reconstruction for hyperspectral diffuse optical tomography (DOT).

The steric crowding above and below the tetracene core prevents overlap between the extended p-systems of the acenes. Substituent effects cause these tetra-substituted tetracenes to have absorbance and fluorescence spectra red shifted from either disubstituted derivatives or rubrenes, such that they have spectra similar to diarylpentacenes, but with higher quantum yields of fluorescence and greater photostability. These new molecules also undergo cycloaddition reactions with 1O2, giving regioisomeric mixtures of endoperoxides, and in contrast to longer acenes, the ethynyl substituents show only a modest stabilizing effect to photooxidation. Ethynylated tetracenes also exhibited photochromism, with their endoperoxides undergoing cycloreversion to yield the acene starting material at room temperature in the dark.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_57615ffb05f9c9d7509c945434861a75"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_d1dbd9785a302a17a08b19bb24c75acd"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Zhang, Jingjing, Syena Sarrafpour, Terry E.

Evaluating the usefulness of these new systems to ensure appropriate implementation, can be a large undertaking as there are many issues to address during such an assessment. This study tracked the interlibrary loan activity from June through November of 2005, 2007, and 2008 of Tufts University Hirsh Health Sciences Library, in order to explore the advantages and disadvantages of participating in the RapidILL resource sharing system. Volume changes, breadth of resource sharing circles, transactional fees, staffing needs, turnaround time, and fill rate, were the main facets of interlibrary loan borrowing and lending activity analyzed.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_a3a97a7386c9d6704989218f50a7366b"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_ce146308fbf1ce6cfdf9adadf7b7beb0"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Rabinowitz, Judy.

Since sphingolipids influence the biophysical properties of membranes, we evaluated the compositions of immune synapse (IS) and non-IS fractions prepared by magnetic immuno-isolation. Broadly, increased amounts of sphingomyelins, dihydrosphingomyelins and ceramides were found in aged CD4+ T cells. After normalizing for total sphingolipid content, a statistically significant decrease in the molar fraction of glucosylceramides was evident in both the non-IS and IS fractions of aged T cells. This change was balanced by less dramatic increases in the molar fractions of sphingomyelins and dihydrosphingomyelins in aged CD4+ T cells. In vitro, the direct or enzymatic enhancement of ceramide levels decreased CD4+ T cell proliferation without regard for the age of the responding T cells. In contrast, the in vitro inhibition of glucosylceramidase preferentially increased the proliferation of aged CD4+ T cells. These results suggest that reductions in glucosylceramide abundance contribute to age-related impairments in CD4+ T cell function.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_e80b76c73e54a0c4d768641fba0d2eaa"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_b96f0df954174b0cbab5e5064908df39"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Molano, Alberto, Zhaofeng Huang, Melissa G.

After performing between eight and 90 of these displays the male either copulates or attempts to copulate with the female. However, females allow only 58% of males to mount them, while rejecting 42%. We have examined 804 of these precopulatory sequences containing 11,841 actions in an effort to determine why females find some display sequences of males unsuitable, while others are accepted. Males have an extraordinarily varied sequence of actions, and sequence variation leading to successful and unsuccessful copulation attempts was similar. Most surprising was the tendency of males to eliminate one of the five actions, whether in successful or unsuccessful attempts. As unlikely as we think it might be as the result of natural selection, the only statistically significant difference we found between successful and unsuccessful attempts was the reduction in the frequency of expression of one or more of the behaviors in successful attempts. These observations, coupled with the large variation seen in most sequences, suggest that there is not a correct sequence, or even a correct set of actions leading to copulation. The male must, however, perform goldeneye species- specific precopulatory behavior as performed by adult males, although it apparently can be performed in a wide variety of patterns.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_2d41a2ba2bc4d60f8221e08801a27070"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_15a00fcae3fd49ddf08e9eec80843a75"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Dane, Benjamin, Rebecca Harris, and J.

The technique is broadly applicable to the quantitative characterization of internal morphology (texture) of image features with well-defined borders. In this study, we explore the capacity of this method for quantitative assessment of intracellular fractal morphology of mitochondrial networks in images of normal and diseased (precancerous) epithelial tissues. Using a combination of simulated fractal images and endogenous two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy, our method is shown to more accurately characterize the exponent of the high- frequency power spectral density (PSD) of these images in the presence of artifacts that arise due to cellular and nuclear borders.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_0812bf097f3e302d0439874c32a1ba7e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_426e5eba9842ebbd74612514aa500ec8"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Xylas, Joanna, Kyle P.

Transmission was reported to be primarily through recreational water contact. Methods: We designed a water recreation area (WRA) to prevent transmission to school-aged children. The WRA features a concrete pool supplied by a borehole well and a gravity-driven rainwater collection system; it is 30 m2 and is split into shallow and deep sections to accommodate a variety of age groups. The WRA opened in 2009 and children were encouraged to use it for recreation as opposed to the local river. We screened children annually for S. haematobium eggs in their urine in 2008, 2009, and 2010 and established differences in infection rates before (2008-09) and after (2009-10) installation of the WRA. After each annual screening, children were treated with praziquantel and rescreened to confirm parasite clearance. Principal Findings: Initial baseline testing in 2008 established that 105 of 247 (42.5%) children were egg-positive. In 2009, with drug treatment alone, the pre-WRA annual cumulative incidence of infection was 29 of 216 (13.4%). In 2010, this incidence rate fell significantly (p,0.001, chi-squared) to 9 of 245 (3.7%) children after installation of the WRA. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine correlates of infection among the variables age, sex, distance between home and river, minutes observed at the river, low height-for-age, low weight-for-age, low Body Mass Index (BMI)-for-age, and previous infection status. Conclusion/Significance: The installation and use of a WRA is a feasible and highly effective means to reduce the incidence of schistosomiasis in school-aged children in a rural Ghanaian community. In conjunction with drug treatment and education, such an intervention can represent a significant step towards the control of schistosomiasis. The WRA should be tested in other water-rich endemic areas to determine whether infection prevalence can be substantially reduced.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_767fabfa1884d1bb1deb1c08f3fb81ea"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_1b966750aa9c82153232b31586a95084"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Kosinski, Karen C., Michael N.

The Xenopus tadpole tail is a complex appendage, containing epidermis, muscle, nerves, spinal cord, and vasculature, which regenerates after amputation. Understanding the mechanisms of tail regeneration may lead to new insights to promote biomedical regeneration in non-regenerative tissues. Although chromatin remodeling is known to be critical for stem cell pluripotency, its role in complex organ regeneration in vivo remains largely uncharacterized. Here we show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is required for the early stages of tail regeneration. HDAC1 is expressed during the 1st two days of regeneration. Pharmacological blockade of HDACs using Trichostatin A (TSA) increased histone acetylation levels in the amputated tail. Furthermore, treatment with TSA or another HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid, specifically inhibited regeneration. Over-expression of wild-type Mad3, a transcriptional repressor known to associate in a complex with HDACs via Sin3, inhibited regeneration. Similarly, expression of a Mad3 mutant lacking the Sin3-interacting domain that is required for HDAC binding also blocks regeneration, suggesting that HDAC and Mad3 may act together to regulate regeneration. Inhibition of HDAC function resulted in aberrant expression of Notch1 and BMP2, two genes known to be required for tail regeneration. Our results identify a novel early role for HDAC in appendage regeneration and suggest that modulation of histone acetylation is important in regenerative repair of complex appendages.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_527ab3911deed5c02cb7b058e5a086ab"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_850695aad30227e8446f0954774dab7a"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Tseng, Ai-Sun, Katia Carneiro, Joan M.

Compared to trauma-exposed control groups, individuals with PTSD also exhibit lower rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activation during tasks involving interference from trauma-related stimuli. However, it is not clear whether relatively diminished rACC activation in PTSD also occurs during interference tasks involving trauma-unrelated emotional stimuli. The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an interference task that involves emotional facial expressions and elicits rACC activation in healthy participants. Findings: While performing a trauma-unrelated emotional interference task, participants with PTSD (n=17) showed less rACC activation than trauma-exposed non-PTSD (TENP; n=18) participants. In the PTSD group, rACC activation was negatively correlated with the severity of re-experiencing symptoms. The two groups did not significantly differ on behavioral measures (i.e., response times and error rates). Conclusions: These findings suggest that relatively diminished rACC activation in PTSD can be observed in interference tasks involving trauma-unrelated emotional stimuli, indicating a more general functional brain abnormality in this disorder. Future neuroimaging studies need not employ trauma-related stimuli in order to detect rACC abnormalities in PTSD.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_4d66de922269281a9c8c0ebd926a61f3"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_73780a28e5b0e0eaea8d1efd1fef273a"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Offringa, Reid, Kathryn Handwerger Brohawn, Lindsay K Staples, Stacey J Dubois, Katherine C Hughes, Danielle L Pfaff, Michael B VanElzakker, F C Davis, and Lisa M Shin.

After a long career managing dime museums and a travelling circus, Barnum hoped to secure a positive legacy through the creation of an unambiguously serious institution. In addition to building and collections funds, Barnum supplied the Tufts museum – as well as the Smithsonian and American Museum of Natural History in New York – with exotic and valuable dead animals from his circus. Barnum brought his influence to bear on the latter two in order to develop his museum at Tufts. His greatest prize was Jumbo the Elephant, whose skin and bones were involved in a contentious tug-of-war among the three museums following his death in a train accident in 1885.</abstract><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict id="aspace_1be609885ebbd5107759b168d6da6639"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Open for research.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite id="aspace_923b67c171841a78f35c68c776d4a6e0"><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>McClellan, Andrew.
