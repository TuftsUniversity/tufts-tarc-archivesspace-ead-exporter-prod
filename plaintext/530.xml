<p>The bulk of these materials were found by contractor David Russell during renovation to Bromfield Pearson Hall during the summer of 2012. Mr. Russell took the materials home with the intent of locating descendents of the papers' authors. He was successful in contacting the son of Louis Berger (see MS199) and through him the rest of the materials came to the attention of the DCA. DCA staff member Veronica Martzahl worked with Tisch Librarian Karen Vagts to arrange for the return of the materials to Tufts.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>In recognition of the work of the Tufts College Engineering School a chapter of Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honorary society, was installed at the College on Friday, December 16, 1927. The exercises were conducted by Arthur D. Moore, president of the executive council of Tau Beta Pi and Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan. Professor Moore was assisted by representative of the Tau Beta Pi chapters at Harvard and MIT and also by Edgar MacNaughton, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Tufts.</p><p>Both undergraduate and graduate students are invited to become candidates of Tau Beta Pi based on their academic qualifications. Juniors who rank in the top eighth of their class and seniors who rank in the top fifth of their class are invited to become candidates for membership in Tau Beta Pi. Graduate students who have completed at least 50% of their degree requirements and who rank in the top fifth of their class are also eligible to become candidates for membership. Others who have had a large impact on engineering and society through engineering are often invited by individual chapters to join as eminent engineers.</p>  </bioghist>
