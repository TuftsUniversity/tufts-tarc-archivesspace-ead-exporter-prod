    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Donald Ross MacJannet (1894-1986), A1916, H1933, H1979, was a benefactor of Tufts University and an educator who established his own international schools and camps. His greatest gift to the Tufts was the property in Talloires, France which the university uses as the European Center.</p>
<p>A descendent of Peregrine White, the baby born on the Mayflower, MacJannet was orphaned at an early age and raised, along with his sister, in the home of a Medford, Massachusetts widow. In 1912, he graduated as valedictorian of Medford High School and entered Tufts College on a partial scholarship. He earned a B.A. in French literature in 1916. He then attended the Sorbonne in France.   During World War I he trained as a pilot. </p>
<p>In 1925, MacJannet founded a school in Paris, known as the Trocadero School. He then opened a second school in St. Cloud, called the Elms School, where students of all nationalities were educated, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, among them. He also acquired some land near Lake Annency the following year. There he started two camps, one for girls and the other for boys, which attracted an international clientele, spreading his reputation as an educator throughout the world. Some of his notable campers include Indira Gandhi, the late Prime Minister of India, and Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart. </p>
<p>In 1932, MacJannet was elected to the Legion of Honor. This was also the year he met a young German woman named Charlotte Blensdorf (1901-1999), a teacher of the Dalcroze method, at an educational conference in Nice, France. They married November 5, 1932 in the Marylebone Town Hall in London. The MacJannet schools operated for seventeen years, closing in the early 1940s. The camps continued until 1964, with a brief hiatus during World War II. During the war, the MacJannets returned to the United States, operating a school and camp in Idaho and helping with the war effort in Washington, D.C. In 1944, they established the Vacation School of French with Tufts College. Located in Arlington, MA, the purpose of the summer school was to educate people in French language and culture so that they might take up rehabilitation work in post-war France.</p>              
<p>In 1944, Tufts president Leonard Carmichael called on the MacJannets to help consolidate the college's dental and medical schools on the new Harrison Avenue, Boston campus. As soon as they were able, the MacJannets returned to France to resume their camps' normal operations. This work also involved aid to French orphans, children who were the camp's first attendees after the war.</p>                           
<p>The MacJannets purchased an eleventh century Benedictine priory in Talloires, France in 1958. MacJannet restored the building for use as an educational facility, using it for twenty years as a center to house educational and cultural events, drawing people from around the world. In 1979, the MacJannets turned the property over to Tufts University, which established its European campus and conference center on the premises.  The MacJannets split their time thereafter between Talloires and their home in Geneva.</p>
<p>Donald MacJannet died on April 4, 1986 in Geneva, Switzerland. Charlotte Blensdorf MacJannet continued the work they had begun together until her death in 1999.</p>  </bioghist>

The material covers not only the personal events in their lives, but many  of the great events of the 20th century,  including for example early MacJannet family diaries (1825), letters concerning Charlotte MacJannet's family in Germany after WWII, correspondence concerning prison camps in WWII France and letters about apartheid in the 1970s.  Also includes correspondence with such 'notables' as Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Indira Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower.  Also included is family correspondence with members of the MacJannet Clan in the UK, South Africa, Canada and Australia.  As part of this series the personal papers of Charlotte Blensdorf MacJannet and Donald MacJannet's sister, Jean Foster, are included.  Due to many interests of the MacJannets, some of these papers also touch on such issues as the schools and camp.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_73756dafc0f8b141d42b3c9743302f58"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Papers are by subject and then alphabetically within a box.

<p>The MacJannet Camps on the shores of Lake Annecy, Haute Savoie, France, founded in 1924, were a delightful summer playground for children of all nationalities until the outbreak of war in 1939.  During World War II the camp was lent to the American Friends Service Committee and was a refuge for war orphans.  The camps reopened in 1946 and sessions were held every summer until the property was sold to Gillette in 1968.  </p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_2c94c7d6066be9864b0a067db5cd6202"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is not arranged.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_1ce5cd658938f530ba3474e9fd8e901d"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>This series may require review before it is available for use.

for the various schools founded by Donald MacJannet.  This includes the Elms School in St. Cloud, France, the Trocadero School in Paris, France, the MacJannet Riviera school in Cannes, France and the school in Sun Valley, Idaho.  Includes some of the materials relating to Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh, who attended the school as a young boy.  This series is rather sparse due to the fact that many of the school records were destroyed by MacJannet himself at the onset of World War II.  Elms School report cards also include some faculty information.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e975df91e20b72a6898efcfc1936c2e2"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is not arranged.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_b8fcf79f4e38ba05b663524a8675550e"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>75 years from the date of creation.
